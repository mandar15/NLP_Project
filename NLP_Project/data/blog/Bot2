People think that if you love somebody hard enough, then everything is just gonna work out.
People are wrong.
I think when you are young, you are hoping that the person will be the right one, the one you are going to be in love with forever.
But sometimes, you want that so much; you create something that isn't there.
All the memories that randomly pop into my head lead back to you.
I'm going to smile and make you think I'm happy, I'm going to laugh, so you don't see me cry, I'm going to let you go in style, and even if it kills me- I'm going to smile.
Do you know what's the worst part about beautiful love songs?
It's knowing that no one is ever going to think about me while they listen to it.
And she said the hardest part about recovery is when you're not sure you want to recover.
Don't be afraid to fail.
Be afraid not to try.
One day your life will flash before your eyes.
Make sure its worth watching.
You have enemies?
Good.
That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life.
We are the music makers, and we are the dreamers of dreams.
There are so many people out there who will tell you that you can't.
What you've got to do is turn around and say, "watch me".
I just want you, that's it.
All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, giggles, jokes, sarcasm.
Everything.
I just want you.
I wonder if you ever think of me.
I can see exactly where I want to be, I just can't see how I will ever get there.
I just want someone to think I'm amazing.
I don't even know what we talk about.
I just listen to thesound of his voice and to his laugh and to the sound of him listening to me.
Sometimes you gotta listen to your brain, just to save your heart.
Smile.
It irritates those who wish to destroy you.
I guess sometimes even the truth is a lie.
And sometimes forever runs out of time.
Fairy Tales are more than true; not because they tell us that dragons exist, but because they tell us that dragons can be beaten.
Not to spoil the ending for you, but everything is going to be okay.
A year from now you'll wish you had started today.
Sometimes, if not most of the time, you find out who you are by finding out who and what you're not.
What we see depends mainly on what we look for.
I try to talk to you, but I don't know what to say.
I'm afraid you don't want me to say anything, so I don't.
But inside of me there are words waiting to come out and tell you how I feel, like how I miss you, and how I love you despite my broken heart, and how I need you in my life.
And especially how much I want you.
but these words may forever stay in my heart, locked inside.
Sometimes I wonder if there are words locked inside you too, but I'll never know.
Why can’t I wake up in the morning and be like “I don’t like him anymore” and actually mean it?
I miss the way we were crazy about eachother.
Missing someone isn’t about how long it’s been since you’ve seen them last or the amount of time since you’vetalked.
It’s about that very moment when you’re doing something and you wish that they were right there with you.
I was finally moving on and accepting the fact that you were gone and in love with another girl.
I finally got the chance to smile again, to say that I'm free from that crazy nightmare.
But then you smiled at me and ruined it all.
I really like tattoos.
I'm planning to get a few more (I only have one at the moment).
I already know the motives and places for them.
Sooo, I got my first one for my 19th birthday and it was over in 10 minutes.
People keep asking me why I wanted to have a bow on my neck... Maybe because I really like bows?
Well I like it and that's all that matters.
So here it is.
(I'm sorry for bad quality.
My computer broke down after I got the picture and I lost all of the stuff I had on it - I had this one on FB)
And here are some motives I like.
I might even get one of those.
I have to admit I have a tiny "Scarf  Obsession".
It started three years ago in London, when I got sick and I needed something warm for my throat.
I bought this huge black scarf and it has been one of my favourites since then.
I wonder if anyone can guess how many scarves I have in my closet at the moment.
:)
A group picture of them :P.
On my nails: OPI meet me on the star ferry.
I don't really like this polish, because I have to apply 4 or 5 coats of it and it looks weird after that.
I'm hopeless.
I have too many clothes already and I keep buying new stuff.
Today I wanted to buy basket for my bike, so I went to Austria.
Then I saw cute knitted (endless) Scarf and matching Hat.
My mum found white Shirt, which I need for my school uniform (yeah, we have to wear uniforms in college).
I have also bought black Korzet and matching Panties.
And I finally got this red T-shirt I bought on Ebay one month ago.
I've made a new blog.
You can check it out by clicking here.
I'll still post quotes on this one, I just wanted to try something different.
I just want you, that's it.
All your flaws, mistakes, smiles, giggles, jokes, sarcasm.
Everything.
I just want you.
I can see exactly where I want to be, I just can't see how I will ever get there.
I just want someone to think I'm amazing.
I don't even know what we talk about.
I just listen to thesound of his voice and to his laugh and to the sound of him listening to me.
I have to admit I have big crush on Niall Horan.
I can't believe I haven't done this "One Direction quotes" thing yet.
I found some really cute pictures online.
Happy Birthday to one of the few people whose birthday I can remember without a Facebook reminder.
Thank you for always being there for me, thank you for being the one I can tell anything to.
Thank you for putting up with me when I was crabby, rude, whinny, and a brat.
Thank you for all the thimees you made me laugh.
Thank you for listening and talking to me.
Thank you for being my best friend.
Thank you for being YOU.
I want to have a perfect summer with lots of sunshine and someone special.
Summer is kind of like the ultimate one-night stand: hot as hell, totally thrilling, and gone before you know it.
The tans will fade, but the memories will last forever.
Summer break -  where you drink triple, see double, and act single.
When the sun gets hot and the moon gets hazy, good girls go bad, and it gets crazy.
'Cause I'm just a summer girl.
I wear my flip flops.
And when I let my hair down.
That's when the party starts.
And who needs a boyfriend.
I've got my girlfriends.
And when we get together, the summer never ends.
I look for you everywhere I go, hoping to bump into you.
But I never see you.
You're not there.
You're never there.
You are: my sugar rush, my cocaine bliss, my illegal high, my perfect kiss.
You're an addiction that I always fail to resist.
It's sad how someone can go from being the reason you wake up smiling, to the reason you cry yourself to sleep.
Some people are meant to fall in love with each other, but not meant to be together.
I hate it when I'm singing a song and the artist gets the word wrong.
Before i go to sleep, I imagine you're by my side.
Take a chance.
You never know what might happen.
You and I will always be unfinished business.
People always ask, "Do you still like him?"
Honestly, I don't really know.
But I do know there's something about him that I can't let go.
Everyone in this world needs someone they can depend upon.
Be it a faithful companion, a trusted confidante, loyal friend, determined advocates or a loving family.
But occasionally in life, the people we thought would always be there for us leave.
And if that happens, it’s amazing the lengths we go to, to get them back.
Sometimes the only thing that needs to be removed is a memory.
In life we all make plans, but sometimes they don't turn out the way we expected.
By trying to help out, we may damage a relationship.
By attempting to reach out, we may push someone further away.
By digging into the past, we may enrich our present.
The easiest way to overcome one addiction is to replace it with another one.
There are many things that bind friends together - Sharing a laugh over an embarrassing incident, comforting each other in times of need, finding it in our hearts to forgive.
But, the thing that binds friends together the most is a secret that changes everything.
Keeping secrets is a lonely business.
That's why we all search for someone to confide in: an ally who will understand, an advisor who we can trust, a friend who will never judge.
I wanted you to fight for me.
I wanted to be someone worth fighting for.
Someday, our paths will cross and as our eyes meet, our hearts will too.
And when that day comes, I swear, I will never let you go, ever again.
There will come a day when I wont think, miss or wonder about you anymore... but I guess today won't be it.
Maybe I'm scared because you mean more to me than any other person.
You are everything I think about, everything I want.
There are things we don't want to happen, but have to accept; things we don't want to know, but have to learn, and people we can't live without, but have to let go.
I'm fighting back emotions I've never had before...all because I'm not supposed to love you anymore.
You know, I still wait for your messages, as sad as it may seem.
I haven't given up the thought that you'll come back to me.
I think about it day and night, and even in my dreams.
If you ask me how I'm doing, I would say I'm doing just fine.
I would lie and say that you're not on my mind.
But I go out and I sit down at a table set for two.
And finally I'm forced to face the truth, no matter what I say I'm not over you.
I've learned that it takes years to build up trust, and only seconds to destroy it.
I've learned that two people can look at the exact same thing and see something totally different.
I've learned to never laugh at anyone's dreams.
I've learned to remember that silence is sometimes the best answer.
I've learned that life sometimes gives you a second chance.
100 years ago, the RMS Titanic sank in the North Atlantic Ocean.
When you got nothing, you got nothing to lose.
"Where to, miss?" "To the stars."
I'd rather be his whore than your wife.
A woman's hears is a deep ocean of secrets.
Friends make the bad times good and the good times unforgettable.
Friendship isn't about who you've known the longest.
It's about who came and never left your side.
A true friend sees the first tear, catches the second and stops the third.
Dear bestfriend, I honestly don't know what I'd do without you.
Best friends know how crazy you are and still choose to be seen with you in public.
I hate myself for always thinking about him.
My friends are already tired of this crap, so I'm really happy I have this blog.
I miss you; all day, everyday.
And you can't even imagine how pathetic it makes me feel because i don't even know if you miss me back.
That random flashback which brings back painful memories and breaks your heart all over again.
You were never supposed to mean this much to me; I was never supposed to fallso hard.
But you know what?
I did and that's the truth, that's what keeps me holding on, because it hurts like Hell to let you go.
I wish there was a delete button in my mind so i could get rid of the memories of you.
Do you know what's the worst part about beautiful love songs?
It's knowing that no one is ever going to think about me while they listen to it.
And she said the hardest part about recovery is when you're not sure you want to recover.
"What are these scars from?" she asked.
"They're battle wounds," I replied.
She looked at me for a long time.
"Who were you battling?"
"Myself."
Do you ever lay in bed at night hoping you wake up in theemergency room and hear the words, "She's not going to make it"?
I do.
My head is such a mess right now.
Sometimes I pretend I'm okay because I don't want to annoy people with my problems.
It's okay.
I gave up on myself a long, long time ago.
Why do I keep doing this to myself?
“What are these scars from?” she asked.
“They're battle wounds,” I replied.
She looked at me for a long time.
“Who were you battling?”
