What is it with me and late realizations?
So this happened a few months ago.
I alighted the bus and was on my way towards the dull brown building.
I expected the usual aroma of a freshly baked bread mixed with coffee as I neared the café-bakery adjacent to my office.
Instead a familiar warm aroma literally made my olfactory nerves jump.
It was the aroma of tempered curry leaves.
The first couple of seconds I was so comfortable with that aroma, that I didn’t realize how out-of-place it was.
When I did realize it, I looked left and right, to find the source.
But then it was gone, just as suddenly as it had appeared.
Every morning when I would get up for school, then college and then work, this was the aroma that actually woke me up.
My mom multi-tasked in the kitchen like a goddess with 3 pairs of hands.
She hurried around to pack our lunch boxes.
My dad egged everyone to get ready and kept them moving.
After all if even one of us was late, he would have to drop them at the bus stop or the station or till the school/college gate depending on how late they were.
Miscellaneous incidents would take place even in that frenzy.
In no particular order - A broken button from the shirt.
A waterbottle that never made it to the school bus.
An polished shoe.
Nails with nailpaint that was supposed to be removed last night.
Last moment requests for money to buy files and assignment papers from college.
Morning news informing about bus/train strikes.
Earrings that didn't match the dress.
And the worst nightmare of all, forgotten homework!
What a morning drill it used to be!
What does it have to do with late realizations you might ask?
Well, that morning when this aroma met my nose, it brought back these memories.
As I pressed the up arrow of the elevator, it dawned on me, how long it had been since I went through this morning drill.
I wished I could experience it again.
I wished I could smell that aroma which started the drill every morning, that smell of tempered curry leaves.
The meeting had adjourned almost half an hour ago, and yet I waited there.
Typing an email, commenting on a ticket, editing a spec.
Finally, I got up and switched off the lights of the conference room.
"Time to go home".
It was Friday evening, so the weird swish-swish of my jeans was the only distinct sound I could hear, as I leisurely walked along the corridor.
I had no reason to hurry home, no immediate plans, nothing special.
"But this day was special, wasn't it?".
I left the building.
There was a light breeze.
It had been exceptionally pleasant all week.
Stepping on to the curb across the street, ready to head towards my bus stop, I turned around.
Standing tall on a backdrop of a sky carelessly painted with a few clouds, was the Space Needle.
I smiled.
It had been a complete year...
Needless to say, the walk to the bus stop and the eventual ride home was filled with nostalgia.
The convocation ceremony, the moving, the good byes and the hellos.
They all came with their sweet and sour tinctures.
So many unbelievable moments had passed in just one year.
I remembered looking at the university's carrier dome from the plane.
What a moment it was.
That was the last time I looked at it from above as a student.
I remembered the many times I stood under that dome, in a line with a bunch of printed resumes in my shaky hands.
My elevator pitch incessantly running through my mind like a video game's background score.
I remembered taking the walk under that dome, being proclaimed a graduate.
I looked outside the window.
The lake was merrily waving at me.
A ferry chugged away in the water.
And the walking mountain stood majestically behind a veil of faded azure.
So many astonishing moments had passed in just one year.
I remembered last Fall when I missed the beautiful maple trees.
I remembered the snowy day I was stuck in traffic on that bridge.
The loud party when I got the scare of my life.
Being lost on my first day of work and being yelled at by a stranger.
I remembered the friendships, some old, some new, and one very special.
They kept me warm in the awkward drizzles.
I remembered the jitters from my first project's launch and the nerves from organizational changes.
But then came to mind the hi-fives from my colleagues.
They kept me afloat in the corporate rapids.
"Almost home".
I entered the gates, when out of no where a little pine cone plopped onto my shoulder.
It pricked a bit.
I remembered how unprepared I had been for almost everything that had come my way during these 365 days.
It must be one of those unwritten axioms of life.
No matter how prepared you are for something, there is always a surprise in store, if not many.
All those episodes that had strolled through my mind on my way home had been those of impending change or the unexpected.
So many great moments had passed in just one year.
So there's something called cross-selling that when put together with association rules ends up giving companies significant profits.
There are customers and segments and campaigns.
Alright, sometimes even I have to give in to the distraction monster.
Even my imagination is not willing to peek out of its shell thanks to the overpowering lethargy that this hour is imposing on my mind.
It's one of those days when I can only think sarcastically.
It's the lecturer's bane that I happen to be in his class on one of these days.
Honestly, but I just cannot digest this topic.
Oh by the way, its customer relationship management.
Ever since the class began this semester, I have only felt like its more about fooling customers with the help of sly techniques.
For some reason I have not been able to get myself out of the customers' shoes and look at these analytics, models and queries in a positive way.
And hence the disinterest towards the subject.
The only thing I can think of doing right now is blankly staring at the projector screen, that is currently displaying a large data flow diagram.
With a lot of reluctance I am going to stop writing and pay attention to what the pedagogue is saying.
Feels like i m getting ready to jump into ice cold water.
Here goes again.. warehousing, business workbench, customer analytics, infocubes, segments, accounting data, profit analysis.
how often has it happened to you, that you halt in the middle of an ardous journey because of a nagging feeling at the back of your mind.
your conscience keeps asking, "why the hell are you climbing this stupid cliff?
it's so difficult and painful.
you don't even know if you will be able to reach the peak.
just look at yourself, all sweaty and beaten.
don't you think you were better off down in the plains before you started this hike?"
it's hard to give a wise comeback to your conscience who is determined to make you end the tenous trip you are making.
but sometimes, all you have to do is turn around and look down at the path you covered already.
the distance you came to fulfill someone's dreams and you will find the answer.
"when i look down at the plains, i can see them looking up towards me with hope and pride.
their happiness is the reason i want to continue this journey.
i won't start the decline now. it may be less painful to climb down, but honestly there's a sweet pleasure in persevering because i know when i reach the top, it will be worth it."
These days I find it difficult to be homesick and not express it.
I have been trying to deny this fact but ultimately, caved in.
Again, it wasn't my weird state of mind, but a picture that triggered this pressing feeling of being away from the place I love the most.
My cousin happens to be an expert at graphics and animation.
While browsing through his album on a social networking website, I came across a design of a living room.
I continued browsing through the album until something struck me and I did a double take.
Was it really what I thought it was?
I left him a comment on the picture, asking if he had really modeled that place or was my perception running wild.
The picture of an old apartment which had lost itself in my mind under many layers of memories.
This was the place where we spent so many summer vacations of our childhood.
It was a time when an old black and white television was one of the many options of entertainment.
Games that were a product of our imagination were top priority on the time-pass list.
The neighbors' kids were our summer pals.
And although we met them once a year, saying hello to old friends didn’t feel like a feat.
It was as though I had popped open a bottle of soda, that was shaken enough so that the entire content spilled out as fizz.
Where were these memories hiding?
The matinee movies we watched on the television on Sunday evenings.
The weird card games we invented.
The crazy stories we made up, not to fool each other but because in our mind's eye they were true.
He-man with his buddies and Barbie along with her friends, would set off on adventures.
The dark space under the bed was a hiding place for monsters.
An endearing warmth spread inside me when all this flashed across my mind.
A one room kitchen apartment had the capability to hold in itself so much joy and love.
The reason is not so hard to figure out, is it?
It was a home.
Some say, home is where the heart is.
After today I beg to differ on this notion.
There is only that one special place in this world, where you can always return, whether immensely successful or totally beaten.
That place, your home will always welcome you for what you are.
ts official - I am homesick.
What I am about to write has been developing at the back of my mind for a long time now.
I finally felt that it was time to key it down.
The first thing I updated on my facebook status on landing home was - "And every time I see you my heart skips a beat..... Mumbai.....
I missed you....." Here's the story behind that thought,
I find the moments before the plane touches ground, especially poignant.
So it happened this time too.
I waited with bated breath as the plane hovered above the clouds.
I watched eagerly for a hint of blinking gold.
Minutes passed.
Slowly a glow arose from the earth.
It grew wider and Mumbai made its appearance.
The city looked like it was studded with golden lights.
There was a layer of radiance that floated above the city.
It was hard to take my eyes away from the sight.
My heart skipped a beat.
The moon drifting some distance away, made the scene even more beautiful.
It was somewhere around 3 in the morning; as expected the city seemed wide awake.
As I looked on, mesmerized to the core, I realized there was a rhythmic beat that Mumbai emitted.
Almost like a live pulse.
The words I had used to describe the city when I first saw it from above in a past email came to my mind, "Mumbai looks so alive... like trying to prove something..."
Be it from above or from within, Mumbai always makes a connection and on evenings like this one, I end up missing it.
There are people who love the city, there are those who hate it, and then there are those who just don't care.
But there are also a few like me who will always see Mumbai as the heartthrob it really is.
Diwali - a festival so special and dear to me, that last week the very thought of spending it away from home acted as a major demoralizer.
And yet, despite all the uncertainty, in complete antithesis to my expectations, this day turned out to be - Diwali.
It began with a long hearty chat with family.
The usual phone calls exchanging wishes with friends.
Already a warm glow was building up inside me.
Maybe this wouldn’t be as bad as I thought.
Afternoon came with a cook-off invitation (although I was made to think it was an invite to just chat and do TP), but hey, with my recently developed fondness for cooking, I didn’t mind it at all.
A Pav-bhaji that threatened to make its way out of the cooking pot any moment with a side of Masala pav, made from the recipe of a surprise cook!
The menu was infused with lots of laughter and a little nuttiness - to be more precise, I am talking the about uncalled-for dance steps being performed during the process.
An episode of f.r.i.e.n.d.s., and more laughter made the meal complete.
A perfect weather called for some outing, and we made our way to Green Lakes.
Fall is now showing its colors and the drive was just as beautiful as the location itself.
The camera clicked away as we breathed in the scenery.
A placid lake surrounded by trees in yellow, orange, red and of course green - perfect wallpaper material.
While some of us ooh-ed and aah-ed over nature, some of us were busy collecting leaf samples and others made analogies for amusingly silly things with the cryptic mysteries of programming.
The trail along the lake, also rejuvenated some humorous nerves and a peculiar alliteration was invented - I am not saying what it is.
A quiet Pooja in the evening and we started off for the temple in this region.
It was a simple temple, unlike most of the temples back home, but the serenity of the place settled down inside me.
A lot of fellow Indians in traditional wear were seated before the beautiful deities.
We could attend the Aarti on the insistence of one of us.
It was a very special experience for me.
As I completed the Pradakshina and faced the deities again, it felt like a piece of puzzle had fallen into place.
I could never have asked for more on this Diwali.
I could have easily spent this day sulking over the distance and all the fun I could have had at home.
But finally it dawned on me today that miles don't matter, but the people do...
It felt like looking into the pensieve, just like Dumbledore did.
A long lost memory had decided to screen itself before my mind.
I think the moral of the story is very much implicit...
One of the games I used to play with kids in the building was, climbing the ladder on the terrace that led to the water tank.
It was more of an activity than a game.
The water tank was the highest point on top of our 4 storey building.
After playing for some time, we kids would sit on a level each of the ladder staring up at the sky or observing the terraces around us.
The ladder must have been about 15 to 20 feet tall, I fail to recollect its exact length because to me, climbing that ladder was way out of my league.
I was expressly forbidden to go beyond the first four rungs of the ladder.
"It is too dangerous.
You will fall."
Those words just echoed in my mind every time I went close to the ladder.
So I ended up being the one sitting at the lowest level.
When summer came, one of my playmates climbed way till the top and sat down on the water tank.
I was awestruck.
Two others used to climb it half way up and stand on a support like beam that used to connect the ladder to the wall of the water tank.
That was some feat too.
For days that ladder continued to entice me.
It was partially peer pressure, but I always wanted to climb all the way to the water tank.
One day, I mustered a lot of courage and reached that support beam.
