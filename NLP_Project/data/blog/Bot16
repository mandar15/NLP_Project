After yesterday, I have stopped to consider the nature of ghosts.
At first, when the spirits were released during my encounter with Flower's Barrow I was aware of their presence but could not see them as such.
Even after the spirit were released, the point that I attribute to an increased control of my powers, I could not see the wayward spooks without their knowledge and permission.
As the past fifteen months have ticked along I have found that seeing ghosts has been the hardest thing to master.
If the spirit wishes to remain unseen then there is very little I can do to unveil their presence.
Oh, I can normally detect that there is something supernatural in the vicinity and if I can't actually see it then it is a good bet that a ghost is attempting to remain hidden.
If a ghost is powerful, such as the individual attempting to make my life a misery, then his presence can be felt when is in the general vicinity.
I hope that I will have more than a little bit of notice if he comes calling.
Finding a ghost is possible only by using a spirit who is willing to help.
They are, without fail, able to see each other even if they are attempting to remain hidden.
In my experience most are reticent to assist, Dirty Gary is the exception to the rule and will willingly spill the beans, especially if he can cause pain and suffering in the process.
I will force myself to find Dirty Gary and ask about Simon.
If he wishes to remain hidden, then I am sure that Gary will be more than happy to put me in touch.
I spoke to Patrick this morning regarding my encounter with Dirty Gary.
He laughed off my concerns about Simon.
'Fuck that mate, he's a bastard liar.'
He barked, waving a hand dismissively.
I was not so sure, what had the spectre to gain by lying other than maliciously creating doubt and making me question what I thought I knew.
I would need to think before I continued with any further discussions with Gary.
I have already explained the nature and background of the ghost 'Dirty Gary' and have described, to a certain extent, how I feel about his vile presence.
Today, unfortunately, I found myself seeking his counsel, his advice and worse, his help.
I knew he was usually ti be found lurking near a wall of the Southsea Police Station, the wall the formed the edge of the female officers shower room.
I loitered in the general vicinity knowing full well that if I was discovered I would be branded a perverse voyeur and summarily arrested, nothing to do with the wall more the small window that opened into the room.
I waited for a while, until I could hear the muted conversation of a number of female voices as they finished their shift.
I felt a shift in the air between me and the wall, I felt something move behind me, I turned quickly.
A face, a distorted greasy face, with a leering grin and blackened teeth grinned back at me.
We were almost nose to nose, I could smell Gary's foul corruption.
'Mister Grayson.
'ave I been 'eating some fucking bad shit about you?'
He sneered as he twitched and jerked, his insubstantial body moving in short sharp movements as if driven by bursts of electrical current.
'What have you heard Gary?' I asked walking away from the wall, towards the main road.
'I've 'eard that you 'ave the sight and are willing to use it.
Sell it to those that'll see us all dead.'
We now found ourselves standing in the midst of a stand of bushes that separated the police station from an area of park land.
'Who told you that Gary?' I snapped, feeling far angrier than I sounded.
His black smile widened into a horrid grin, the black stumps of his teeth made me feel physically sick.
'Someone you know.
Someone who knows you.'
He responded slowly.
I remained silent allowing him hs moment of triumph.
'Someone is...' he paused again, 'Simon.'
It worked, his build up and delivery left me cold and shocked.
'I don't know a Simon.'
I barked, far too quickly and with far too much denial.
He licked his teeth with almost sexual delight.
'Well he fucking knows you Mister Grayson.'
I need time.
Time to think and more importantly time to build more courage to talk to Dirty Gary, again.
Living with Patrick is a bit like looking into a mirror.
Every time I make a choice I get a response, an honest response.
The decisions I have made will no doubt have consequences for others, in particular those that I have in mind when I make those decisions.
I have thought long and hard about those points I made last night and have come to the conclusion that:
A) I will endeavour to continue with my approach to contact Simon &
B) I will talk to Dirty Gary to find out about the bilious nonsense that the being 'Karl' is spewing
We'll see.
After deciding that a positive course of action was my only option I lay awake last night running through a number of possible first steps.
To mind there are very few available and those that are obvious leave me little room for manoeuvre.
There are a few questions however, primarily how, if true, the protagonists from the new project have learned of my ability to read the auras of the otherworld.
Enough said, I need to think on this and the consequences either way.
At least my black eyes are beginning to fade and my blocked snot-box is allowing me to breathe a bit better today.
Hanging around, or more correctly, moping around and feeling very sorry for myself, for nearly two days has, evidently, began to irritate my host.
Patrick finally lost his patience around two this afternoon.
He was right though, I have become so reliant on others and in the process exposing my friends and associates to unnecessary harm.
Pat actually glowed brightly as his temper increased and he released his pent up frustrations.
I soaked it all up, the truth of the situation cutting very deeply.
I had just immersed myself in my own petty, selfish feelings of loss and rejection.
I had been sheltered and protected  by those who had not expected anything in return.
Now that my name had been elevated to one of above nominal importance those that had harboured me could be in danger.
Flower's Barrow had left its mark on me, a mental and emotional scar that would last for the rest of my life.
My Nemesis, or the one I now thought of as my Nemesis, was capable of unknown atrocities and possessed immeasurable powers.
I needed to come up with a way forward, a positive course of action that would not involve those that had significantly more to lose than I.
I do believe that the entity, Karl, is the evil force that I encountered during the Flower's Barrow days then his positive counterpart may be the place to start.
At the same time I will attempt to contact Simon, but I hold very little hope for any success in that department.
But, and Pat is very clear on the subject, I need to stop being a 'fucking wimp' and take charge.
With that in mind I will visit the servicemen's cemetery tomorrow and literally see what I can see.
I have, a few minutes ago, emailed Simon on the only email address I have.
I need to find out about Silver Puppet and I need an ally in the realm of ghosts.
It seemed like such a good idea last night, but so often instant decisions which stem from a half-baked idea.
It started with a large glass of sherry, it was all we had in the house.
Patrick poured most of a bottle of Harvey's Bristol Creme between two grubby tumblers and offered me one.
I normally loathe Sherry but the way I felt last night I would have drank anything to numb the pain.
The Sherry went down very quickly and to my head almost immediately.
Patrick took longer than me to finish his drink, as the last of the liquid slid down his throat a determined look appeared in his eye then suggested that we go out for a few drinks.
Stupidly, I agreed.
Less than ten minutes later we were in a noisy bar near the seafront drinking Guinness.
This was the start of a heavy couple of hours, many pints of Guinness later we found ourselves in a very loud, busy and boisterous.
By this time I was feeling a little drunk.
OK, I was more than a little drunk, I was very drunk.
Patrick has an enormous capacity for alcohol, this is linked to his heritage, which I will not go into at this point.
I remember staggering into the toilets, I may have knocked over a few drinks on the way but as my memory is hazy I could have convinced myself that this was the case.
I leant forward with my head resting on the wall as I noisily released my stream, sighing in relief.
I then registered that, not only was the toilet full, there was a queue.
I also noticed that the young, wiry and notably less drunk, using the urinal next to me glowed with a blue glow.
For some inexplicable reason I made eye contact and muttered:
'From the sea then mate?' It was more of a slurred series of syllables than a coherent sentence.
'You what?'
He asked.
'You're a sea being mate, I can see it.'
For some reason he took offence to this.
I saw bright lights and a flash of blue.
I heard the 'C' bomb dropped and realised I had been too.
I lay in a puddle of piss and blood for a few seconds before I was picked up Patrick.
'What the fuck have you been playing at matey?'
He intoned as he dragged me out of the pub onto the windy, cold street.
I remember thinking how sober Patrick appeared, well, sober compared to me anyway.
'That's the last time I take you out on the piss.'
He chuckled as we lurched towards home.
Patrick was somewhat cold towards this morning but later he thawed and accepted that there was no harm done.
I am ducking the issue, I need to get in touch with my erstwhile colleague from Flower's Barrow and find out about the replacement operation.
I'm not in a great state at the moment.
I may have made a mistake by going back to my home, to my house.
I don't know what I expected but whatever it was what I actually experienced left me cold and feeling alone and isolated.
The road where I used to live, that was painful to say, is quiet and as such I knew that if I spent any time loitering and watching then I would most likely be the subject of too much attention from the curtain twitchers.
I paused opposite my front door and looked in through the window into my front room.
Who was the man?
Who was the man hugging and kissing my wife?
I stayed, still and quiet and staring at the happy scene in what I still thought of as my front room.
I heard a noise by the pub and noticed that a couple of bald, agitated thugs were taking a firm interest in my presence.
I wrapped my shemag tighter around my face and left, still very conscious of the stares that followed me.
I'm back at Patrick's now and still the images run through my mind.
I know that I shouldn't, but, I suspect that at some point in the near future I will endeavour to get in touch with Emma.
After my scare last night I slept little, not a surprise as I ended up sleeping in a bus shelter.
This morning I took the first bus to the nearby town, where I changed and ended up at the nearest town with a railway station.
It was still early, the carriage I boarded was empty, well almost.
A single sleeping remnant of last night snored gently in a corner.
It wasn't long before I was doing the same.
A station before my stop I awoke to a carriage almost full to capacity, as my vision swan into focus I saw that there were four or five otherworlders in the carriage with me.
They were different colours, two red a brown and a green and as they wren't together nor of similar alignments, I wasn't unduly concerned.
When the train pulled up at my final destination I was more than ready to jump off.
Three of the otherworlders disembarked at the same time as me, I loitered on the platform until they had all left.
Finally I passed through the barriers and out into the street.
The shadow bastards swooped and dived, coming close to me but not quite close enough.
I shouldered my bag and set off to find Patrick.
I wandered for some time until I found the confidence to call Patrick.
I spent over an hour ensuring that I was not being followed before I huddled into a disused shop doorway and called Patrick.
He was expecting my call and met me presently.
I am now lying on Pat's sofa writing as I watch him drink beer and fart while he watches the Hairy Bikers, am I any better off?
I know that title has been a tad overused, but last night I had a rather disturbing encounter.
Having left the cosy arms of a warm and welcoming community, I fell back into a cold and hostile one.
With no couch surfing available I had to revert to hostels and the first hostel I fell back to reminded me why I hate them.
I should have smelled a rat when I first arrived an there were no other patrons for the night.
The night porter, it was nearly midnight, was strangely cheerful (another bad sign) and showed me to an empty dormitory.
Without a thought I undressed, leaving my clothes on the floor and, in the gloom settled into a cold silent bed.
As I sank into the depths of sleep, far too quickly, alarm bells rang in my mind, but I could do nothing to arrest my fall into the arms of Morpheus.
As I struggled for the last time, my eyelids heavier that ever before, I was sure I could see shadows rise from beneath the bed.
They swirled quickly and formed into a tall, looming, mass.
With treacle and fear it leant over me in a moment of wild terror and memory.
Then I was awake; awake and aware.
The room was just a room and my clothes were back on my body.
As I thumped down the stairs and past the abandoned reception desk I saw the scattered oblivion of an old building.
What the fuck had I been thinking?
I have broken into someones shed, I have a pound coin by the cheap padlock so that it can be replaced, but I do feel far more secure and happy here in a small, freezing shed with no bed, blanket or hope.
I will move on properly tomorrow.
I suspect that at some point in history, tales of vampires and tales of Wendigo coincided and caused confusion between the two.
The name comes from the native American people the Algonquin but Wendigo, under whatever name, have existed, and indeed exist, around the globe for centuries.
The characteristics portrayed in the media of suave, mysterious, being with great strength, charisma and presence are more true, in reality, of the Wendigo rather than the the vampire.
Thankfully Wendigo are rare but they often occupy positions of power and importance, in fact I have heard of a very prominent celebrity who is purported to be a Wendigo.
I have seen this individual on TV and could not tell whether or not this was true.
In fact it is true that I cannot see any auras on TV or through any lens or device, it is almost as though I do not 'see' rather my brain receives its stimulus be other means.
The Wendigo is a feared and even respected otherworld being, coming into contact with a Wendigo is dangerous to say the least.
The power of the Wendigo is their ability to absorb the qualities of their victims by devouring their flesh and drinking their blood.
This means all physical, mental and supernatural elements possessed by an individual are taken on by the Wendigo.
Just hope that if you ever have the misfortune to meet a Wendigo that you have nothing they deem worthy of further attention.
As I sit here on yet another railway station platform writing about the Wendigo I remember a story Patrick told me about his close encounter.
A few years ago Pat was working in a coffee shop in London, a small place near Tottenham Court Road.
I feel that I need to explain something else as this point about auras, well not just auras but about the ability to detect otherworldly beings.
I can 'see' aura of all otherworldly beings, some others can detect through sight, smell or touch beings close to their own kind but ALL Wendigos can apparently see, smell, and feel ALL otherworldly beings and detect their abilities with uncanny accuracy.
There are lot of media companies in the area who tended to use the chic coffee shops, it was a new executive from one of the larger organisations that frequented Pat's shop.
Initially surly and curt, when Pat served the attractive dark ,haired woman her demeanour changed.
She became polite, charming and flirty eventually engaging Pat in conversation regarding a vacant position within the company.
Pat was completely taken in by all this and agreed to meet up after work to discuss this.
At this time he was completely unaware of the identity of his potential benefactor.
Luckily for him, in hindsight, he was hit by a car during his lunch hour and spent some time in hospital.
During this time a friend of Pat's who also worked at the coffee shop became the target of the Wendigos affections.
He, had powers arising from the air and only escaped when the creature revealed itself because some air elementals can 'phase' that is move in short bursts at extreme speed, so fast that they appear to leap from place to place without passing through the intervening space.
Thus uncovered the Wendigo soon departed to feed elsewhere.
My train is due.
More later.
Gareth had stayed out later than his shift.
I had told him about the gathering of fire elementals, he works with one, evidently and asked.
I realised that discussing such matters between otherworlders was generally frowned upon and that Gareth had put himself at risk by asking.
Thankfully he had mentioned why he was enquiring the fewer people knew about my current whereabouts the better, it would also make moving on covertly a damn site easier.
A quick note on factions, for want of a better word.
The elements are the basis for the various alignments between the otherworlders, particularly Earth, Water and Fire.
The earth faction, generally green or sometimes brown, are currently the strongest.
They are the tree folk, got-men, goblins, boggarts, trolls, phooka and brownies and are in a constant struggle with the water faction; Merrow, merfolk, kelpies, selkies etc.
The fire faction; djinn, drakes, dragons, salamanders etc. tend to see-saw between the two, lending their support and aid as they see fit or as and when it convenient and beneficial for them.
The air faction have managed to remain neutral for decades now, as far as I can tell.
There are other entities that remain un-aligned, the vampires, shadow people and werewolves I have already mentioned in a previous post but there are others the worst of whom is the Wendigo, more of that later, tomorrow probably as I will be on the road and will have time to write, or maybe Monday.
The only other significant faction are the ghosts, they are incredibly powerful and view the struggle between the elementals as beneath them.
Gareth managed to find out that the fire faction are being wooed by the earth faction and some major move against the water faction will no doubt be the result.
This made me feel a bit more secure as the encounter on the South coast may have been coincidental, perhaps not directed against me.
Gareth agrees that I need to drop below the radar for a while and find out as much as I can.
He will cover my tracks the best he can and remain silent about my intended activities.
He has also suggested that if asked a little misdirection would not go amiss.
I have my bags packed and will be on my way this afternoon.
Gareth was still asleep when I got up this morning.
He hadn't returned home until well after four this morning, I know because I was awake and toying with the idea of talking to him there and then but thought better of it.
He had proved difficult to engage in conversation at the best of times, I didn't want to leap in with a heavy subject when he had just finished a difficult shift at the factory.
So I left it alone until this morning, unfortunately he wasn't bloody waking up.
