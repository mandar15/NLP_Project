Promise me you won’t leave
And I promise I’ll stay forever
Promise that you’ll love me
And I promise I’ll do whatever
Promise me the moon
And I promise you the sun
Promise me the stars above
And I promise you already won
Promise me a wish
And I promise you a dream
Promise me no broken hearts
And I promise you a scheme
Promise me you’ll promise
To do what must be done
But don’t forget, a promise
Can become a broken one.
That poem was inspired by the promise I made to the filly the last time I saw her before she went away: to be back.
It doesn’t matter how much you mean what you say: a promise is a promise, and a promise can always be broken.
Anyway, moving on to something more cheerful, I want to clear up some stuff.
In my last post, I mentioned lost progress, but I’ve also mentioned (some time ago, really) that the filly was much less shy.
That was true for a time, but at this point she’s skittish again, although hopefully not as much as she was before.
What I was trying to stress was the broken connection; it was like she didn’t know me.
She wasn’t really scared of me, but she wasn’t of anyone.
It was like I was just one in the crowd, and that was almost as sad as when I learned she was gone in the first place.
What if I’d known?
What if I had known that she was leaving, but in nine long months, I would see her again?
It was like my promise had never been broken… only compromised.
So is a damaged promise better than a broken one?
Onto the clinic:
I got up at 6 45 and got ready; we left at 8. Once at the barn, I visited with the filly and generally just hung around with the girls at the barn and Bonnie as they readied their horses (Bonnie had already gotten Tonka ready for me, since I couldn’t be there the night before).
We left with Tonka and a pony from the barn, Jack, and when we got there, unloaded and groomed and hung around some more while waiting for Jen to arrive (she had to make an extra trip to pick up a horse).
Once she was there, everyone tacked up and we headed out to the ring.
Basically what we did was practice with different types of jumps, and longer courses.
The facility was really nice.
It even had a huge covered ring with lights, and footing that was shredded carpets mixed with sand (probably around $600,000 overall), although we didn’t ride there – just walked out our horses.
It was amazing.
I had a ton of fun.
:D Tonka got fast once, but he was pretty good otherwise.
I really need to get better with my leads, though.
:( I can’t even check them anymore.
I know that I need to be looking for one leg going out further than the other, but I can never tell.
It’s so embarrassing.
I want to ask Bonnie how to check them, but that’s even more embarrassing – I’ve been riding and cantering for years, and I pick now to tell her I don’t really know how to check my leads?
I mean, sometimes I guess right, but others I don’t.
I’m just lucky that Tonka always changes  them for me if they’re wrong.
*sigh*
Well, that’s what went down this weekend.
Peace.
:)
I owe you all (*waves to empty space*) an explanation.
It’s been so long… It feels strange to be blogging again.
Strange, but kind of nice.
In a weird, unfamiliar way.
This year has flown by so fast.
I can’t believe May is already half over – I can’t even believe it’s May.
It feels like stuff keeps happening, and I can never catch up.
Some of it I won’t say here, since I’ve learned that no matter how much you want something to be private – well, it’s the internet.
Nothing’s private.
So some things I can’t say… but other than what I can’t tell, I’ll give you the lowdown: 
Well, for one thing, I’ve moved this week.
We’ve been in the process of selling our home since… well, a while, and I’m glad we’re finally out.
I’ve been so stressed out, thinking about money – I still am, but it’s easier not to panic when we’re renting such a nice house for now.
It’s by the beach; yay :) 
School has been taking up a lot of my time, but I haven’t even thought about blogging; to be honest, I never thought I’d update here again.
But I’ve been thinking, and I want a record of this time.
Besides, it’s a good way to process my thoughts.
Ugh – I really don’t feel like blogging about RL right now, so I’ll just skip to who I actually do want to write about: the filly.
My filly.
For a while after she came back, I was hesitant about approaching her again.
I could remember the hurt, and I know that she won’t be here forever.
I have no idea how much longer we have.
I thought, it might just be better for me to distance myself from her now – build up a kind of wall between us, and block out the hurt.
That’s what I did for a couple months – I basically treated her like any other horse.
Then I realized what I was doing.
This was  the horse I literally sobbed over nine months after I’d last seen her.
We had something special, some kind of connection.
And to let that go to waste now that I had the opportunity to be with her again was appalling.
One really disappointing thing was all of our lost progress.
Before, she was always happy to see me, and came as soon as I called her.
Now it was like she didn’t even know me; I couldn’t hold her head, and I most certainly couldn’t call her in and out of her paddock at will.
But, over time and the short visits I’ve had with her, we’re slowly getting back to where we were.
She changed a little during her stay… well, Elsewhere, but she’s still my pretty girl, and I love her just as much.
Today was a pretty big landmark for me.
I went to a clinic with Bonnie, Jen (Bonnie’s trainer), and girls from the barn on Tonka.
It was really fun, but maybe I’ll talk about that tomorrow.
Anyway, so I had some time at the barn, and I visited the filly.
First, I was in for a shock.
Her cut was SO much bigger.
It goes through these cycles where it gets very large in the summer, and practically heals up completely in the winter.
Bonnie and me think that it’s because of the flies: in the summer, she gets itchy, and rubs her face.
Once she reopens her wound, the flies swarm on it, and it itches more.
It’s terrible.
I wish I could have her – but my family doesn’t have the funds, and more importantly, I don’t have enough knowledge or experience, for that.
Still – I can dream, and I hope that one day I am able to buy her, once I’ve moved out and have a job with which to support all of the expenses.
She and Luna had also switched stalls, she was shod, and her whiskers were trimmed (which is a big thing for me, since she’s NEVER had her whiskers trimmed as far as I can remember).
Once I said hello, and scratched the poor girl’s face (her cut looks so terrible, it’s got some yellowish thing in it.
I think that may be the medicine they put on it, but I can’t tell), I went out to the paddock fence and called her: Heyyy, pretty girl.
I clicked a few times, and she came out to meet me.
It’s not the single-call instant greet we were at before, but it’s a huge step in the right direction.
(I would have taken a picture of her, but my phone was almost dead and it wouldn’t let me use the camera.)
I feel so bad, though.
Her cut itches so much, at first she only scratched herself on her hay and didn’t bother to eat it.
I asked Bonnie if a fly mask might help her, and she said it might, but you’d be hard pressed to get one on her.
She’s right.
I just wish she weren’t so wild… but the sick thing is, that’s why I was first attracted to her.
But now that I know her, I just want her to feel better.
Anyway, it’s getting late, so I’ll have to leave off for now.
I’m always surprised at how much I type once I get into it.
This is definitely something I need to continue, and I’ll make a note to keep updating.
Hopefully weekly, but I’ll see how it goes.
It’s good to be back.
:)
First we met,
On that fateful summer’s day
First I saw you,
And my heart melted
Faster than the sun would allow
Your eyes were soft and trusting
Although your plight was great
My heart went out to you
And so our bond was made
You knew me more than others
You came at a single call
My heart would swell with love
When I looked at you
But then you went away
And my dreams and hopes
Were crushed by cruel reality
Yet I could not stop myself
From wishing, praying, yearning
To see you again
One day a message came
That made my heart spring forth
And jump for joy
I could not believe
The words I read
How long had it been?
A month?
A week?
A year?
But you had returned
Soon I was able
To see you again
But now you do not remember
Those fateful summer days
When I would laugh and cry with you
And we would escape reality together
Now I can’t help but build up a wall
Between us – you and I
A wall I never before
Would have dared to create
For what will happen now?
Will it be a month?
A week?
A year?
When will I lose you again
To cruel reality?
How can I bear it again
The pain that I went through
But how can I stand
To not reach out to you?
You’re different now—
They’ve changed you
But your heart is still the same
Your soul, too
Remains as it was
On that fateful summer’s day
Love, something in
My gut tells me
To give it one more try
And that “to love and lose
Is better than not to love
You at all”
Let’s do this now, together
Working at it
You and me
Let’s do this now, together
We’ll make it, girl
You’ll see
Is it possible that my filly’s return was a Christmas miracle?
I don’t mean to get all sentimental, or foolish, but… it just seems like it was too amazing to be a coincidence.
Anyway, Merry Christmas!
Or Happy Holidays, depending on if you celebrate it.
I had a very pleasant day – mainly because I didn’t have to go to my father’s house at 10 00 AM like last year, which ruined Christmas entirely.
Bastard.
(Moving on.)
It was lovely.
I spent a lot of time with my family, including my grandpa, and tomorrow my mom and I are going to go shopping.
I’m going to my dad’s at noon, which is why I’m on so late (I’m getting up at 6 45 AM, gah).
I have to do laundry and pack, since I won’t have time tomorrow.
*headdesks repeatedly* Why didn’t I do this sooner?
I felt like I left out Luna/Houdini when I wrote before.
Well, let me sum it up with this picture:
Get away, bitch!
Luna’s grouchier than usual.
Then again, that might be because she doesn’t remember me – who knows?
But I missed her, too.
Mostly because I loved watching her and the filly touch noses.
She’s prickly, but not altogether unkind.
Sort of like the characters you see in books.
