Hey there.
Have you exercised your right to vote, yet?
Whether you back Romney or Obama, we as Americans have the priveledge to go out there and have our voices to be heard.
Too bad that many of us choose to be silent and then complain about the outcome.
While America is out to voting to elect as their leader, I wanted to share this little comic that makes a very strong point for certain mustachioed friend.
lol  Later!

Last night, I took part in a podcast for the very first time.
And you know what... it was freakin' awesome!
I have contemplated doing something like that before but now, having that first taste of being with a group and conversing over topics, I now know that I definitely want to do a podcast.
I have more than a few ideas that I have already come up with and I'm with talks with friends and family about which idea would be most likely come to fruition.
I want to change it up for you guys and I also would love your opinions.
Not only do I plan on getting a podcast going, I also plan on integrating video posts.
Maybe a retro game review?
A quick video on this week's game releases?
Maybe have some kind of Q&A?  Interviews perhaps?
I would like your input friends!
Comment below and let's see what we can come up with!
Later!

Hey there.
I just renewed my domain name with GoDaddy.com for another 2 years.
I've learned that if you want to be taken somewhat seriuos in this online world, you have to have your own domain name.
More opportunities come your way and it's easier to find your site when it comes to online searches.
For those of you that know me, I'm always looking for a good deal so I was fortunate enough to have a Godaddy .Com domain renewal promo code  to use for Metallman.com!
I added a few promo codes here if you guys are looking for a Godaddy .Net renewal promo code or even a more recent Godaddy .Co renewal promo code.
I'm not the biggest of fans of the .Co since it's just one letter fewer than .Com but hey, I guess we're running out of domain names, right?
lol  Anyways, I was able to find a few more GoDaddy promo codes so feel free to take them and get your domain registered or renewed!
Hey there.
I was recently contacted by our good friends at FixMeStick and was offered an opportunity to try out their latest product:  The FixMeStick.
Let me paint a picture for you.
You're off, browsing the web like we all do, purchased some music, viewed some funny videos, and then... your computer crashes.
Oh man...
You get it load up but you notice it's a little sluggish.
Then there are a few pop ups that don't seem to want to go away.
Worst case scenario, the computer won't even boot up anymore because of the viruses and malware that have infected your computer.
Before you even get a chance to assess the damage, the virus or malware have taken over your computer.
You now consider it "useless" and need to get your tech friend to clean out your computer and hope to have it working soon.
Now, how many times have THAT happened to you?
I can tell you right now that I have cleaned out my fair share of computers and laptops and it can be a tedious task since computer threats have been getting smarter and more difficult to find and eliminate.
The FixMeStick makes this tedious task of virus removal extremely easy!Conventional methods of cleaning out a computer usually requires you to run an antivirus or antimalware program on your computer or laptop.
The problem with this method is that because your operation system is running, you have already given the threat a chance to hide.
After you run your scan, you still have to go through your processes, start up programs, and files looking for something out of the ordinary to make sure you can get rid of it.
Another pain in the butt that you may encounter is that the admin rights have been revoked, making it extremely difficult to make changes to your computer.
When that happens, it's almost as if you don't have access to the computer when you are not allowed to run programs!
It severely handicaps you in your battle against malware and viruses.
The more technically inclined may be able to get around this but trying to run a program off a CD or USB flash drive.
The problem there is that this method does not guarantee a legitamite scan of your computer.
So how does the FixMeStick work?
It's quite genius, actually.
When you run the FixMeStick program, you are running it off of a basic Linux/Ubuntu based operating system.
Because your infected operating system never boots up, any threats on your computer never had the chance to start up and hide itself.
The powerful megascan (is that name taken yet?
lol) is powered by 3 of the top names in internet security, Vipre, Sophos, and Kaspersky, so you know that any malicious threats will be eliminated when found.
When the program first starts, it will ask for to connect to an internet connection.
This internet connection is for definition updates.
I strongly suggest that you update the definitions each time but it's not necessary.
You can still run FixMeStick without it.
Once the scan is finished, you'll have your computer back and fully functional!
Really, how awesome is that?!  How easy was that?!  Before the FixMeStick, I would spend an afternoon scanning, updating, searching, researching, and re-scanning trying to get all of the infections off a computer.
It could really be time consuming.
With the FixMeStick, I've never before cleaned out a computer so quickly.
It's a must have for anyone that prides themselves in computer care and maintenance!
In simple terms, the FixMeStick is THE BEST solution for eliminating malicious threats on any PC!!!  It's so easy that even a non geek can use it!
lol
To be fair, I did run into a small snag when I first tried out the FixMeStick.
About 5 minutes into running the program, it stopped unexpectedly.
I tried restarting the FixMeStick, as suggested, but nothing.
I was a little discouraged at first and reached out to their tech support.
Within an hour or so, I received an Email from them and 10 minutes later, the FixMeStick was up and running without any additional issues.
Huge props to their tech support for solving my issue quickly.
Being a tech guy myself, it's frustrating when your new gadget doesn't work properly and it was quite a relief to know that the FixMeStick tech support jumped on my issue right away and solved it within minutes.
Now... who wants one of these bad boys?!?!
The awesome people at FixMeStick not only provided a stick for me to review, but offered to provide one to one of you, my faithful readers!
You know what that means?!?!?  GIVEAWAY TIME!
This giveaway will run from now until Nov. 15th and will be open to everyone.
Please be aware that international winners will be asked to pay for shipping cost so please take this into consideration before entering.
Good luck!
Hey there.
Who's looking to score on some awesome deals?
Who wants to get the stuff they want at a discounted price?
Who doesn't like feeling like a winner?
We've all seen the ads for penny auctions and their promises for awesome stuff for pennies on the dollar.
The problem with those penny auction sites, though, is that you have to purchase bids and once you use them and don't win the auction, you're out of luck.
Not only do you NOT get what you wanted but you lose out on the money you paid for the bids.
This is where DealDash is different!
DealDash is the fair, honest, and risk free alternative to those penny auction sites.
How so?
Well, you will be bidding on stuff for pennies on the dollor, BUT... you can do it risk free.
If you’re a first time bidder on DealDash and use all your bids without winning a single auction, DealDash will return all the bids from your first bid pack purchase, for free, to give you a second chance!
Bidding on DealDash is also risk free thanks to the Buy it Now option.
If you don’t win the auction, you can buy the item you were bidding on for its regular price and get back all the bids you used in that auction for free.
This way you not only get the desired item, you don't lose the bids and can use them again to try and win another auction.
Deal Dash offers a no questions asked 100% money back guarantee on your first purchase.
If you are not satisfied for any reason, DealDash will refund your entire first purchase – no questions asked!
Feel like a winner and join the longest running auction site in the US.
It's longest running for a reason, friends!
If you are looking to feel like a winner, DealDash is the place for you!
Later!
Hey there.
Last week's episode was pretty cool and this week's was even better.
If you are not watching AMC's The Walking Dead then you must not like great television entertainment.
lol  Anyways, the third season started with plenty of excitement and this episode definitely continued down that trend.
We finally got a glimpse of another group and we find out what ends up happening to Herschel.
If you haven't seen this episode, step away and check it out.
There will be SPOILERS in this post.
Now here are my thoughts on...
So the people that Rick's group encounters are actual prison inmates.
Turns out that they were locked in the prison food storage area and were left in there by a guard in an attempt to protect them from the outbreak of zombies that entered the prison.
I want to believe that they really were inmates but a part of me thinks that there is more to them.
The leader of the inmate group, Tomas, was very edgy knew his way around the prison very well.
It could be that he was in there for a long time or it could be that he and his group's job was to patrol the prison for outsiders.
Why do I think this?
Tomas claimed they were in the food closet for a good 9 months or so, yet, when Rick and the inmates agree to split the food down the middle, the place is stacked with food.
If they were in there for so long, I do not believe that there would have been so much food in there.
Then again... it is feeding a prison but I figured that food supplies would replenish what was lost.
But the big question is... if they were trapped inside a supply closet, who let them out???
Carl is beginning to show himself to be a little bad ass himself.
Last week's episode showed him carrying a gun and providing cover fire for Rick.
This week, he goes off by himself to look for an infirmary to look for medical supplies, killing 2 walkers like it was no big thing.
Lori tore him a new one but Carl, being the only child in the group, is probably trying to prove himself to be an asset to the group.
No one told him to go look for supplies, he went off on his own and we do not see any of it.
It's just brought up for a minute or two and that was all it took to see Carl in a whole new light.
His intentions may mean well, but that carelessness may lead him and possibly the group into some trouble down the road.
I also wanted to bring some focus on Rick's character.
I noticed that Rick makes decisions for the group and that is that.
He, alone, made the decision to cut off Herschel's leg and the show made a conscience effort to show the group's silence before Rick grabbed the medical ax.
When the group confronts the inmate group, Rick is clearly the alpha male and asserts himself so.
He doesn't give in to the demands of the inmates and actually deals for half of the food supply in exchange for "house cleaning."
During the episode, we see Rick kill Tomas and we see him show no mercy to another inmate that runs off and runs into a group of walkers.
Rick locks him outside and lets the walkers have his way with him.
Eerily similar to how Shane walked away from Otis.
Also, at the end of the episode, Lori and Rick have a very brief heart felt moment.
Rick almost immediately recognizes it and squashes it goes any further.
Again, Rick walks away and leaves Lori distraught.
