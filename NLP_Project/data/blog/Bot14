Dear Oprah,
I have a feeling that we are some what acquainted ….I mean… I know you, that is, from TV of course, and perhaps…perhaps you have heard about my blog “The List” (www.the-list.co.il/en)
I have been trying to contact you since May 2011, especially through the people that surround you.
You might have already heard about my project, and perhaps my name is registered in your “black list” comprising those who are trying to reach Oprah Winfrey and should be kept away… :)
No, I’m not CRAZY.
I’m just someone who wants to meet you in person, so that I can thank you, face to face, for being such a source of inspiration to me and for giving me the strength to stand up on my feet again after being confined to a wheelchair for two years (the full story is here); and yes so that I could tell you a few words in private, words which I leave FOR OUR MEETING.
…I know, I just know that this will indeed happen one day…
In case that you have not heard about me from the hundreds of employees of the O magazine in NYC who received a personnel letter from me last month, or from your employees at HARPO (I traced their names, one by one, simply by watching several episodes of your last season and I have sent them an email via Facebook.
By the way… no one has answered me.
Good workers :)
So… if you have not read my previous message…this is my story…
My name is Yuval Abramovitz, I am 34 years old and I lןve in Tel Aviv, Israel.
On 1. 5. 2011 I started an international blog in both Hebrew and in English called “The List”, whose purpose is to inspect and to put to the test the individual’s determination and inner strengths.
I have set out to accomplish ten missions in 400 days.
One of them is to meet YOU!
The purpose of the blog is, in fact, to conduct a “social” test online - to see what would happen, should I publish my own wishes and ask people to help me out in fulfilling them (the list of my wishes can be found in this link…….:)
Within a week I received e-mails with tips and advice (including the e-mail of one of your aids and the address of your Chicago residence) and more e-mails offering help kept coming in daily.
The most amazing thing is that people from all over the world (Iraq, Norway, Rwanda, Denmark, Australia, the United States, the PA, Israel), began sending me their lists, sharing their dreams with me.
The real magic began when people started reading each other’s notes and did their best to help their new friends to realize their dreams.
Here is list from Israel and here from all over the world
I myself  began to fulfill my dreams as they appear on the list: I lost some weight (and soon even ran a marathon), I am working on turning the idea conveyed in “The List” into a TV program, I have “adopted” a homeless individual and I am helping him to rebuilt his life and Australian fellow-bloggers invited to visit their country and I plan to do so in the near future.
The only “hopeless” item on my list seems to be my wish to meet you.
I tried everything within my power to arrange for a meeting with you, but failed.
Naturally, you are protected by an impregnable wall.
I am writing this post because I read on your site that you are planning a seminar.
I know it is for USA citizens only, but I would have given a lot, had I been able to participate in it….. Friends told me that I may seem obsessed or even mad.
I certainly hope that this is not the impression that I am giving.
I just want to share my life story with you and tell you about “The List”.
This is in fact my last appeal, should I be able to meet you, I will, regretfully, have to take this wish off my list.
Looking forward to hearing from you, very much so!
At 16 I was crippled by a useless accident.
In one fell swoop my life was over and my plans of becoming an actor, a journalist and a couple more unchecked adolescent fantasies flew right out the window.
I turned into a boy in a wheel chair and my wildest fantasy was making to and from the bathroom in one piece.
According to the doctors, the damage was severe and permanent.
I refused to accept this verdict.
I had a list of things I was going to accomplish in my lifetime and it hasn’t even started yet.
After 18 months in a wheel chair (two of which I spent hospitalized in the neurological ward) I stood up.
I was a long, excruciating process before I found myself getting up and walking in the street, but it was the greatest lesson I’ve ever learned.
I call that accident “the gift”.
I learned that with enough will power and a list of goals, one can overcome a fractured scull and lumbar vertebrae that spun in their place.
I learned that life is too short and can flip in heartbeat, so I decided to make the best out of every moment I’m here and strike while the iron is hot.
This, in short, is the reason for my hyperactive being on this earth.
Get it done, get it done, get it done (also: get some sleep, get some sleep, get some sleep) – that’s my life’s motto.
My interpretation of Theodor Herzl‘s “If you will it, it is no dream”.
Everything’s possible, all you have to do is aim for it.
Ever since my recovery, I’ve been organizing my life with lists.
I set myself daily, monthly, yearly goals to achieve.
I wanted to be an actor so I got into acting school.
I wanted to b a journalist, so I started writing for ‘Yediot Achronot’, Israel’s leading newspaper.
I wanted to appear on a daily TV drama show, so I got accepted into “Our Song”, a popular Israeli TV series.
I wanted to go to the Cannes Festival, so I talked to my boss in ‘Israel Today’ magazine and I found myself in front of Woody Allen (and checked a ‘V’ on that dream), Naomi Watts, Russel Crowe, Oliver Stone and many others – the list goes on and on.
I wanted to play in the theater, publish mystery novels, go bourgeois, find my dream apartment, bring a child into this world, find a big love, make money, start a business.
It’s a simple principal: I thought it, I did it, I checked a ‘V’ on it.
A combination of will power and “The Secret” techniques, which I got to know on the ‘Oprah Show’.
A few weeks ago I found a yearly goal list I had written for myself three years ago, sitting on a park bench in London.
I had set myself 10 goals for that year and accomplished 7 of them.
As always, a couple of things got postponed to the following year.
“Get in shape”, “Learn to paint” and “Learn French” are continually the ones I transfer from one yearly  list to the next.
I’ve been telling myself “some day I’ll be chiseled ” or “one day I’ll have the patience to sit myself down and learn French”.
Why is it that I have the self discipline to write an entire book in a matter of weeks, but I simply can’t bring myself to go to the gym and get on the treadmill?
How come I can learn by heart a 60-page script in less than 24 hours – but can’t get a single French word into my head?
The answer probably lies with will power, strength and stamina.
Anyway, I decided enough was enough!
It’s time to fulfill my dreams and check my entire list.
I truly believe in the power of will, the force of the Internet and social networks and in human kindness.
I believe that through this blog, where I’ll be documenting my journey towards crossing out every item on my list, and with the support of the www surfers, I can accomplish anything.
Even my craziest dreams (for example, interviewing Oprah Winfrey on her network.
What can you do to help me?
this link will take you to my list (I’ll explain some of the other things further down the line).
If you think you have the capability, the patience and the connections to help me spread my message and make my dreams come true, or perhaps if you know someone who knows someone who knows Oprah Winfrey – you’re welcome to contact me on this blog and help me.
Do you have an original way to teach French?
A deep understanding of the science of six-packs?
The will, connections or even the money to found a unique non-profit organization for children?
Do you know people in he United States or  Australia that can help spread the word?
Send them a link to this blog.
Do you have a creative mind?
Join me on my list journey!
Any help will be appreciated and (if you want) your name and  info will be added to my Thanks page so that you too can gain some exposure.
Come help me prove that the world is small and the human spirit is tremendous.
My list is starting N-O-W.
In 400 days I will have crossed everything off it.
Yes, even the impossible interview with Oprah Winfrey or crossing Australia without spending a single dollar or rehabilitating a number of homeless people who call the Tel Aviv benches their home.
The countdown has begun..
What about your list?

Liked the blog?
I’d be very grateful if you could spread the word and recommend it to your Facebook friends or on your Twitter .
You’re also welcome to think of ways to help me make my dreams (which you can find here) a reality.
2 days into the journey.
398 days to go…
Everyone has dreams, some of which could be pretty wild.
I knew that way before I typed the first letter of my blog.
I felt that this might be the thing that would make people relate to this blog and perhaps even push them into action.
And indeed, only one day after the blog went online, it got 5,000 views (most of them were from Israel, but also from the United States and even Iran).
I received about 100 e-mails from people who revealed to me their most secret, unspoken lists.
Some said they’ve never made this kind of list, neither in writing nor by heart.
Some of them were easily persuaded to post their lists on my blog, on the “Your Lists” page.
However, most were very reluctant to do so.
They were embarrassed, shocked, surprised.
“What, you mean have other people read my wish list?!”, “How embarrassing!”,
“What if I fail?”
So what?
Then you fail!
What if I fail?
If I don’t get a six-pack stomach, if I don’t meet Oprah Winfrey, don’t fly to Australia, don’t rehabilitate a homeless person, don’t get my high-school diploma?
At least I tried!
In my mind, living with ש sense of a missed opportunity is a much harder experience than that of living with the sense of momentary failure.
I’d rather live with the knowledge that I tried something than having life pass me by while I flip through the channels of my life.
If you have a list of real wishes and tasks, share it with me and the world.
Change will come simply by letting out your inner voice.
I promise to try and assist with two feasible tasks.
As for my own personal journey – what’s happened so far?
The Israeli media has started to show interest in the blog.
I appeared on the “Night Tube” tv show - click here (that deals with all Internet related issues) and spoke with popular DJ Iris Kol on “Nonstop” Radio station – click here.
I was approached by several magazines and am currently in negotiations for all kinds of possible blog-related co-operations.
By and by, a new mission emerged: to get acknowledged overseas.
As a media personality, it’s relatively easy for me to get exposure (that is, if you leave out professional intrigues, competition and lack of support from certain journalists).
But in order for this project to make it big overseas, I need international exposure.
That’s where you come in.
Do you know any journalists who work outside of Israel?
Send them a link to this blog!
I started e-mailing all sorts of relevant people abroad; the most well-known of them is Robin Sharma, author of “The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari” and a modern day guru who helps millions of people take charge of their life.
I met him a decade ago, when I interviewed him for Time Out magazine.
I recently interviewed him again for “Israel Today” paper and on the following day we corresponded lengthily about some of the subjects that came up during the interview.
I was convinced he would be the first to offer his assistance.
I haven’t heard from him since.
As for the tasks:
I started going (or to be more precise – running) to the gym.
I suffer and agonize on the treadmill, but in my mind is the coveted six-pack stomach.
One of my high-school teachers read about my ambition to get my diploma (teacher: “Send me your grades” Me: “There aren’t any! There’s nothing!”) and invited me to complete my exams in the upcoming summer and winter.
These days I’m busy forming the plans for the execution of my list.
I’m amazed (but not surprised) to discover people’s generosity.
I’ve received more than a few e-mails from people who want to “donate” French lessons; a gym wants to assign me a personal trainer, a certain organization offered to advertise the blog on the sides of buses, a woman in the States wants to send me an abs work fitness DVD and some entertainment industry people have started pulling some strings in order to get to Oprah.
To be, undoubtedly, continued…

It was nearly a decade ago that I met Robin Sharma, author of the worldwide best-selling book “The Monk who Sold his Ferrari” (as well as many other best selling books) and a modern day philosopher who travels the world, lecturing and helping people realize their dreams.
At the time, I was “Time Out Tel Aviv”‘s head writer and I was assigned to accompany Sharma for an entire week.
It was inspiring.
The man wakes up every morning at 5 am, then spends every waking moment ceaselessly trying to make the world a better place.
During his workshop, he asked each of us to send ourselves a personal, motivational letter.
I recently found my letter.
Ten years have passed and I had accomplished every mission I set for myself.
I met up with Sharma not long ago for an interview for my current paper, “Israel Today”.
Earlier this week he logged on to “The List” blog and asked to publish this article, so it may further inspire us all to write down our lists and make them come true.
An article by Robin Sharma:
Isadore Sharpe started a little company called The Four Seasons, with a single little hotel, in 1961.
Did deals based on a handshake.
Spoke his truth and kept his word.
Did great work and offered great value.
Well, good things happen to people who do good things (key thought to remember).
The Four Seasons, now one of the planet’s most successful hotel chains, recently received purchase offers from the likes of Bill Gates and other heavy-hitters.
Friends and colleagues of Izzy Sharpe said things like “he deserves all the great things happening to him”.
Stands to make hundreds of millions.
His reputation continues to soar.
Fitting way to tie up his Cinderella Story.
Lessons I took away from these recent events:
1. Stay true to your vision/dream.
There’s something to be said for just staying at what you are trying to achieve well past the point everyone else gives up.
Life rewards the (unreasonably) devoted.
2. Stay true to your values.
In a world of fast-buck artists and people playing the short-game, Izzy took the long-view.
Built high-trust relationships.
Protected his brand.
Underpromised and overdelivered.
Didn’t care if others were unethical – stayed true to himself.
3. The little things amount to big things.
Izzy’s dream started small.
But he tended to it daily.
Small daily elevations compound into massive results over time.
Remember that success comes via those daily “1% Wins”.
So model Izzy – no matter what work you’re doing today.
Because leadership is all about Leading Where You’re Planted.
And it’s not about the size of you’re title – but the depth of your commitment.
yours, robin

During the week since the blog went online, I found myself flooded with hundreds of e-mails from readers in Israel and the rest of the world.
Most people encourage, cheer me on, offer their יmodest (or generous) support, but mainly wonder how I’d be able to accomplish all the missions I set for myself – or as one of the more skeptic readers wrote – how such “unrealistic” things can be realized.
In my opinion, It all lies in Strategy.
Careful planning, one step after the other on the way to your goal, whatever that may be.
In order to build this strategy, two PR masters (who happen to be husband and wife) have signed up to help me – Zeev and Dana Yanai.
Thank you!
In everyday life, “Strategy” is a sacred word for me.
I always work strategically.
Before going to the grocery store, out on a  date or to a business meeting.
About ten years ago, when I was in acting school, I bought a British book that pretended to be a guidebook for young actors.
The book’s opening sentence was “They won’t open the door for you?
Climb in through the window”.
I instantly connected to that line, because this is how I live my life.
I’m one of those who try to climb through the window, and if not through the window then the gutter or even through the keyhole.
When some people hear the word “NO”, it makes them crawl inside themselves, lie under the covers and wallow in their own depression, whereas I belong to those whom the word “NO” only motivates to prove to the other side that “YES” they can.
I was talking to a friend of mine who’s looking for work in the entertainment industry this week.
He consulted with me as to who he should turn to for a job and then prided himself on contacting a very prominent figure in the industry a couple of years ago.
“I sent her an e-mail two years ago”, he said with pride.
