And if you are interested in this type of fresh information to help you in your love life be sure to sign up for my FREE Dating Tips & Relationship Advice Newsletter.
SECRET #1: The Habit of Care-Full Communication
No I didn’t misspell “careful.”
I spelled the word “careful” with two “L”s because when a couple’s words and actions are full of care, they are more likely to be the lucky ones who stay in love.
In fact, the love researcher, Dr. John Gottman, has observed this in  thousands of happy couples.
His research, as well as that published by my husband and I, find loving couples liberally use four insurance factors when they communicate with one another:
Affection
Appreciation
Respect
Validation
In-love partners, whether they have been together one month or 25 years, maintain a ratio of 5 of these positives to 1 negative interaction (like a criticism or a complaint) in their relationship.
This ratio of positive and loving behaviors coupled with acts of kindness provide a bedrock of connection and win-win teamwork.
Below are two exercises that will help you and your partner cultivate the care-full communication that leads to a happy and passionate relationship.
It is especially important to practice these exercises if things are rocky between you.
Relationships can end in a heartbeat.
The Five to One Process
Exercise #1:
Read over this exercise with your partner.
For the next hour or so when you are talking or hanging out together, try to act the way you usually do.
But take two notebooks and each one of you write down the number of positive or negative words/gestures you yourself are making toward your partner.
Take another hour and deliberately double the positives.
After this, discuss the experience together.
You may find yourselves rolling with laughter.
This is good!
Not taking things so seriously will set you both free of your negative patterns.
Exercise #2:
On your own, track the number of positive word/gestures you put out to your partner.
Now, double the amount.
Now triple it, and watch what happens.
If you keep it up, eventually you will get positives coming back to you.
Practice giving and receiving them!
It is very critical to create care-full communication with your partner.
Attention to and practice of this skill will go a long way to creating a passionate relationship.
Otherwise you risk losing it all.
Many studies that compare single people with couples as to their quality of life and general health and happiness come to conflicting conclusions.
Some say that couples are happier and healthier while others report that singles are just as well off.
On top of that common sense tells you that bad coupling and marriages aren’t going to be good for either party’s well-being.
In fact, many writers have flat out said that marriage is toxic to women.
I think the key to understanding these confusing results is the variable of couple satisfaction.
Most studies have simply not measured the couple’s happiness as part of their experiments or surveys.
Of those that did, here’s the overview: Bad or unsatisfactory coupling or marriages may contribute to health and psychological problems while good coupling may protect you from certain diseases or help you to recover faster.
But before we get into the research I’d like you to have fresh information like this blog delivered to you free each week.

We can’t go into all of the research so here are the findings from a few of the major studies.
A study of long-term coupling in which the partners were unhappy, showed that women more than men were likely to suffer from high blood pressure and obesity.
Others have shown that poor coupling or marital quality was associated with depression, worsened physical health, poor sleep and metabolic problems.
We’ve also already shown that once a woman is divorced or separated that her economic, health and general well-being are all adversely affected.
In other words, there is a severe penalty for being in a bad relationship that never-coupling singles don’t pay.
In fact, singles with strong social support have been found to be nearly as well off as women in good relationships.
That’s because social support and love are probably the key drivers behind many of the positive findings in comparison studies of singles, married, living together and divorced women.
So what about women in satisfying relationships?
In comparison studies, they had the least atherosclerosis in their arteries and lived much longer if they did have heart disease.
They had fewer doctor visits, lower blood pressure than singles or women in unhappy relationships.
Studies of long-term couples showed that they report fewer headaches and back pain.
Happy couples healed twice as fast from flesh wounds than those who demonstrated hostility toward each other.
In fMRI studies of the brain, men and women in long-term relationships showed activation in the areas of the brain associated with dopamine, that is, the passion centers, as if they were newly coupled.
There is no question then that the social support of a loving partner contributes to having a healthier, longer and happier life.
Bottom Line: Coupling by itself is not an answer to all of life’s problems.
Being single today combined with a strong social network of family and friends, is a very viable alternative to even a healthy relationship.
But is a good marriage toxic to women?
No.
If you do decide to couple, choose someone who is a good match, someone who is devoted to you and committed to handling the inevitable bumps and potholes that you will face on your journey.
Because if it does not go well and you separate, the research suggests that you will suffer more than if you had never married.
On the other hand, a good relationship is worth creating and working on because it can have other many positive effects on your health and well-being.

Today’s relationship tip  blog is written by one of our expert Love Mentors®, Karen Holland.
Karen shares five relationship  tips for how to communicate about a touchy subject (without triggering a fight).
1. Soften Your Start Up! — If you go on the attack (or you start with a manipulative comment to get a certain outcome), you will get met with resistance or defensiveness.
And wind up mired in conflict.
Examples of how to soften start up:“Honey,something’s been bothering me.
Can we talk for a moment?”
“I know when we’ve talked about this in the past it hasn’t gone well, but I’d like it to be different this time.”
“Hey, is now a good time to bring something up?
I’ve been bothered about something and just thought we should clear the air.”

2. Use non-verbal gestures to keep the connection while you talk.
Lightly touch knees, hug, hold hands, offer a glass of water, help each other if in the middle of a task, etc.
This can be really soothing to someone who gets anxious when there’s tension between you.
Also, it might be better to talk side by side rather than face to face.
3. Try making a repair in the middle of the conversation if you see the conversation is not going in the right direction.
Repairs might be something like: - “Oh!
I didn’t mean to say it that way, can I start again?” - “Wow, I really messed that up right now.
I’m really sorry.” - “I don’t like how this is going.
I’m afraid we’re going to start yelling like we always do. – Can we start over more calmly?”
- Humor or gentle teasing (especially poking fun at yourself) is a great way to ease tension.
4. Don’t resist when your partner is sharing a concern or complaint.
If you resist, it persists!!
You won’t allow your partner to get over his/her frustration or feel heard if you keep resisting what s/he is saying (by being defensive, criticizing in return, withdrawing from the conversation, etc.).
You don’t have to agree with them, but it goes a long way to validate what they’re saying.
Examples of ways to validate and not resist: “Okay, I can see what you mean…” “Okay, I really got what you said and how you feel about that… You feel this…” “I know, I see your point…” “Yes, I know, I do that sometimes” “It must be hard feeling that way…”
5. Don’t talk when you’re moderately to extremely upset or angry.
This is a critical relationship tip!
While it’s completely normal and healthy to get upset with each other, it does no good to talk about your issues when you’re too upset to talk well.
Signs up being too upset to talk: -Racing pulse -Flushed cheeks -Tight chest, jaw, fists or arms -Eyesight narrowing -Stomach churning – Crying uncontrollably -Yelling or feeling like you want to scream, throw, hit – Being lost in thoughts, past arguments or rehearsing your point of view over and over.
Here’s an exercise I teach my love mentees to master tip #4.
It really makes a difference when they want their partner to listen and understand.
Even hard-headed guys actually go for this.
Practice Making Requests and No Resistance
Write down a common complaint (take it easy) and practice sharing it with your partner.
Pick an A and a B.
A – Start with sharing your feelings about it and then make a request.
Remember to be soft, don’t attack, blame or criticize.
B – Validate and don’t resist what s/he is saying (remember, say things like “I see what you mean” or “Yes, I know I do that…”
Switch
The point of this exercise is not to resolve issues but to share and learn that you can listen without resistance and bring up concerns without going on the attack.
What happens when we look in a mirror?
We say “You’re so fat!” “Look at that wrinkle!” “You are definitely getting old!”
All these things and much worse.
Can you imagine saying to your best friend, “You are a mess!
Your rear end is as big as a house!”
We would never say these kinds of things to a friend.
But when it comes to ourselves, it is a whole different story.
Imagine turning the loving attention and appreciation you give to your friends and family over to yourself.
Imagine if you could stop the negative self-talk about being too old, too fat, too whatever.
Imagine how it would feel to appreciate yourself for a change not defensively, not in reaction to negativity, but with real self-love.
The kind we want from a lover but never learned to give ourselves.
Inside each one of us is an innocent, lovable self, just waiting to be discovered.
If you are quiet long enough and sit with yourself, you will discover a beautiful ineffable essence that Kahlil Gibran calls, “a fragment of the Divine.”
And I’ll show you how to find that fragment within because doing so is a key secret in creating self-love.
And it’s the type of knowledge I share weekly in my Dating Tips & Relationship Advice Newsletter.

I know this whole business of self-love may be hard to relate to–like an impossible task for YOU–because of the negative chatter in your head about yourself or that the feelings of fear and anxiety can be overwhelming at times.
So for those of you who are single or in unsatisfying relationships today’s step in our journey together is this: Fall in love with yourself and then you will find the love you seek.
When you treat yourself well, you will choose partners who love you.
As within, so without.
This is one of the ultimate secrets for attracting a terrific partner.
Well Dr. Diana, you are wondering, how do I overcome my usual self-pity party and learn to create self-love?
In our love mentoring program we teach four powerful techniques for discovering and honoring your highest self, what I call the Diamond Self.
My own mission has been to help others develop their Diamond Self because that is the royal road to Love.
So here is one SUPER POWERFUL way to start building that magical part of yourself so that you can begin attracting more love.
This process will take only 15 minutes or so but it will change your life.
Think back to when you were an infant, toddler or young child–when you were all smiles, alive and in the moment.
You were born with innocence, natural curiosity and joy in the world.
The original you was a fully present, adorable little being, in touch with all of her blissful feelings and naturally assertive and self-expressed.
When you were that sweet child running around, what did you enjoy?
Was it the running around, or cooking on your Fisher Price play stove?
Maybe it was sitting still staring at a bumble bee.
Were you a big talker or a chubby witness who sat on your potty throne and took it all in?
Did you love to finger paint?
Think back and remember that early time when you were free to play and explore the world.
What were you like?
This is a time before you were boxed in by your parents’ and society’s expectations, fears, and neuroses.
Before you were ignored, shamed or told you were bad.
Before the limitations and fears set in.
Chances are all those early traits are still with you, in their grown-up manifestations.
And they are all utterly you and OK.
In fact, they are charming, even captivating.
But they may be entirely hidden.
I have an old photo of myself from that innocent first era, before I closed down my heart and got shy to the point of being mute.
It shows a cherubic three year-old in a beloved park where I used love to race around and climb all the rocks.
I am sitting in the dirt, grinning wide-eyed at the camera, posing with joy and confidence, an impish tomboy in my dirty polka-dot dress.
I keep the picture by my computer and look at it with great appreciation almost every day.
That is me.
In fact, when I watched myself on The Today Show recently, I giggled outright because I caught the tomboy imp in a dress staring back at me from the TV set.
Now take out a photo of yourself as a toddler or baby–you in all your innocence – that child who was born whole, perfect and beautiful.
Put it near your computer or somewhere else where you can look at it several times a day.
As you look at it, notice how wonderful, incredible, truly lovable that child is.
For one second at a time, glance at the photo and prize that child who is you.
Love moderately: long love doth so; Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
~Shakespeare
When it comes to dating, the Bard got it right.
Moderation is key.
It keeps you from moving too quickly or too slowly when you’re getting to know new men and what they bring to your table.
And the most powerful way to achieve moderation is by dating more than one guy at a time.
On my Soulmate Dating Program, you avoid that pressured decision to sleep with a guy and its aftermath: a Flame Out that usually kills the relationship.
Instead you date a number of men at the same time without having sex with any of them.
By not seeing any one man too often, you find the men who are really into you and who will stay the course.
Plus, you break out of your prison of deadly dating patterns and maneuver more skillfully in the dating world.
In my experience, this dating program is the best way to find your Soulmate.
Although the idea of finding, much less juggling, a few guys may sound challenging — if not downright impossible!
— let me reassure you: it won’t be once you begin using all the tools I teach you.

Why It Works
There are three sound biological reasons why the Soulmate Dating Program rocks!
First of all, it helps you avoid the number one mistake that single women make: the addictive moth-to-a-flame over-involvement with some new guy who is supposedly the “One,” which I call the Flame-Out Deadly Dating Pattern.
This is because romantic love is a real addiction.
It is like using cocaine or heroin, which means reason goes out the window.
When we “fall in love” our brains make large quantities of dopamine and norepinephrine, which also happens when you take speed!
These brain chemicals create the excited, exhilarated and focused state that allows us to have eight-hour dates and remember every detail about what our new hottie did and said.
These speed-like chemicals also can drive up our levels of testosterone, which increases libido and desire.
Second, when we fall in love, serotonin levels fall and resemble the levels found in people with obsessive-compulsive disorders.
So we tend to ruminate, fantasize and obsess about our new (drug-like) boyfriends.
The new love is in our thoughts all day and in our dreams at night.
Your brain says, focus on him, focus on him, focus on him.
Once this process takes you over, you become like a craving coke addict.
