I've been thinking of posting something, anything about GMOs for quite a while.
But this blog is more of a creative outlet, an online journal, really.
After years of this, it's morphed into a public way for me to share personal thoughts with my mom.
I always think about her when I post.
Per the news, I feel like I'm supposed to only post things with future employers in mind, but I just think about my mom.
While I do post about foods, I don't get too in-depth.
I have another url for that though I have never used it.
I have a vision in mind but I have never acted upon it.
Maybe when I get a better computer...one that isn't so old that when I update firefox it suggests I "Get a new computer."
I digress.
I used to be junketarian.
For fourteen years I didn't eat meat.
Instead, I ate a lot of junk food.
I rarely ever ate a raw fruit or vegetable.
These days I grow my own fruits and vegetables!
Nowadays I am more concerned about eating foods fit for human consumption than whether or not it's a fruit, vegetable, dairy product, or meat.
I look at nutrition labels and it helps me avoid ingredients that are actually chemicals.
But there is no label to tell anyone if the food or chemical they consume is based on genetically modified ingredients.
Last weekend I visited my mom and when I mentioned GMOs, she had never heard of them.
At work I hand out a GMO pamphlet received from my Dr. Bronner's rep, which was published in part with the non-GMO project.
Because it's after 8pm on a Sunday and I'm tired as heck, I'm going to just type some things from that pamphlet, and also paraphrase.
I'm uploading photos from my old PC to flickr and wanted to document a few that caught my eye.
I don't feel like I've gone through a metamorphosis, but when I look at pictures from only a few years ago it allows me to remember the ups, downs and changes I've experienced.
I took this picture from an upper floor of the Eagleton building.
Cameras aren't allowed inside since it's a federal courthouse, however, at this time I was a regular visitor for my Account Manager position at BCBSMo and I had a good relationship with my contact there.
She worked it out with security so I could take photographs the day before Thanksgiving when court would not be in session.
At first I thought she was heckling me but then I realized she just wanted to talk about Halloween....
There I was, minding my own business, meandering in the shoe area at a thrift store when suddenly a girl says to me, "Hey!
How old are you?"
Thirty-four."Well,
you don't dress like it.
Most grown-ups wouldn't wear those shoes with that skirt."
Then she called me short.
I asked her how old I looked and she first answered six, but quickly changed her answer to twelve.
I asked her if this was a good or bad thing and she said it was good to look younger.
Then she asked me what I wanted to be for Halloween.
I don't have a costume picked out yet because I'm not doing anything which will require me to dress up.
She's dressing up as a ghost, but she doesn't really want to be a ghost.
She wasn't mad about it, but her mom picked out her costume and she wanted to decide.
Just when I started wondering how I was going to get out of this conversation, a worker announced that we had exactly five seconds to make a purchase.
I was lucky to visit Triple S Farms today.
It was an eye-opening experience to talk with Stan and learn what it means to raise food (animals, meat, hamburger, bacon, Thanksgiving turkey) and feed them well, treat them well, give these animals a well-cared-for life with plenty of food, water, shelter and as little stress as possible.
It's late, I should be sleeping.
But y'all should know (and by y'all, I mean my mom) that today was super awesome.
I'd rather focus on each tiny, small instance and think of my time in blocks of ten seconds here, four minutes there.
I don't want to categorize my experiences, summarize them, shave off all the details so my one week fits into a three-sentence description.
Each moment, experience, few seconds, all the little stuff strings together into a long blurred-together thing I feel like is - life.
Feeling those moments - is living.
The things that are important to me, the seconds and minutes that make me feel alive and think and wonder and discover, the majority of the billions of humans on the planet wouldn't even care about.
And that's why life is so cool.
I finally finished that owl!
I thought it'd make a great present for Amy's birthday.
It still needs grout; I probably won't get to that until this weekend, but that's a faster pace than what this project has been used to.
I tiled the owl two years ago, made the tree a year ago, then tiled the background over a weekend.
An unexpected death is a strong reminder for me to appreciate each moment and focus on the positive aspects of life that I need to be consciously thankful for.
There are many great things happening to me every single day and if my life should end abruptly, I want it to end on a positive note.
Being happy all the time seems like a lofty goal, especially when you take into consideration PMS and the irritabilities that occur while interacting with other human beings.
All I can do is try.
I wrote down a quote and regretfully did not manage to capture who said it, so if I went before Judge Judy and tried to quote this statement, she would throw it out as hearsay.
Today I came home to find a lot of really nice messages from people who saw the vulture mosaic on flickr.
Some have been commenting on my photos for a long time, others were complete strangers.
Their words brightened my day.
I appreciate when people take a moment out of their life and dedicate it to me.
I am sending double-extra Mahalos to Salvation Art for following my progress and cheering me on for months and also to Terry Nichols for sending me an encouraging email.
My favorite comment was from ratherbmosaicing, who wrote, "This is absolutely an amazing piece.
It's spectacular, magnificent.
The details just blow my mind.
The texture, andamento blending/merging of the colors in the black/white/gray in the feathers, beak, bone, claws, neck feathers, the anger in his eye.
My dear - what could be better about this piece?
It's outstanding."
A close friend of Eggs' has been in the hospital for a while now, dying.
While Jen has been comatose, Eggs visits her regularly.
Eggs thinks of her.
She talks of Jen's health, her life and her life choices; this and so much more weighs heavily on Eggs.
So we spent this show talking a lot about life and death and what it means to be and feel alive and what death means and how to accept death.
We didn't speak of all these things on the air because it's too personal for Eggs right now.
But once again, what we communicate to each other behind the scenes while everyone else hears music, the importance of our conversations cannot be weighed or measured against anything else that I have encountered on this planet.
In this photo I was 19 and my dad was 41.
We (I wonder what my mom and brother were doing that day?) went to a family reunion / 40th birthday party for three people, two of which were not even turning 40.
My dad explained that the family was so big, they were getting tired of throwing parties so they decided to ball up the last three into one just to get them out of the way.
I don't remember anyone's names or where this was, I just remember it nestled within cornfields down a long gravel road.
When my dad had his fill of catching up with everyone, he drank the last of his beer, crumpled the can in his hand and said "let's go!"
We didn't even say goodbye, just walked to his truck, telling anyone who asked what we were up to, that we were getting drinks from his cooler.
We were parked down the road but had to turn around and drive past the party.
My dad just honked and waved.
It was fun.
I use that exit strategy often.
I hate saying goodbye.
I've graduated from photos to short videos.
Pictures are not enough; I need to capture life's minutia in 10-90 second blocks.
If you believe in those who can see the future, you may have either watched one of their shows or visited them in person to get some insight into your own life.
They never tell you about the tiny moments.
They only tell you about the big stuff.
Someone you were close to died.
You're going to die sooner than you want to.
Maybe you can live on the moon in next century.*
It is a nice day.*
Never trouble trouble til trouble troubles you.*
If you continually give, you will continually have.*
Now is the time to set your sights high and go for it.*
Yadda yadda yadda.
*Fortune-cookie fortunes in my wallet.

Thank you ree-creation-mosaics, anna_dc, Remygem, dixlips, and Lucia Vanhoof.
I especially want to thank Nathan Renzor for writing, "I LOVE IT for So many reasons, the texture, the spot of color and face detail, great wings., the bone.....
I could go on.
GREAT!"
I also appreciated reading, "This is so good, the texture in the feathers and the background are amazing" from Joolz.

I planted these sunflowers from seed on 24 May.
They grew much taller than I expected them to, shading my Brussels sprouts so much that they never produced food.
Okra is that tall stuff in the front.
Broccoli is just behind the okra.
Chard is at my feet.
Peppers, Brussels sprouts and tomatoes are behind me.
I chopped down the cornstalks weeks ago.
Kevin McKenzie warned me not to underestimate how big each plant will get.
That's been one of the best pieces of gardening advice I've received.
It's very easy to crowd one plant out by another.
My okra towers over me and two broccoli plants, two tomato plants and a baby blackberry bush.
The corn was also planted too close together, but it survived because I watered them plenty.
Next year I will plant a new row each week for 4-6 weeks.
Corn is mature and ready to eat 60 days after planting, so this will ensure I have fresh corn for a couple of months.
wish my phone were able to capture all the bee activity happening in my garden.
There are several varieties of bees and dozens of each type, buzzing from flower to flower, doing their thing.
I'm glad I can provide an organic environment for any creatures.....which is why I don't mind the rabbit who's been hanging out for the last month.
I have an overabundance of food so I don't mind sharing.
I had NO idea the sunflowers would tower over everything!
I thought they'd be as tall as my corn but as it turns out, they're twice as tall!
And blocking sunlight for my Brussels sprouts, which never were able to produce food.
Also, I'm not sure what happened to my eggplant; it had many flowers, but none materialized into anything, not even a teeny-tiny eggplant.
Conversely, my corn, tomatoes, kohlrabi, broccoli and okra produced lots and lots of food!
You'll probably find a variety of bees if you can manage to look close enough.
They love my garden.
Instead of reflecting, let me tell you that during a DJ meeting this afternoon, I took a tube of toothpaste out of my purse, held it up to Jodi (who was sitting clear across the room), squeezed out a liberal amount onto my right index finger, and then smeared it on my lips as if it were lip balm .... to make Jodi laugh.
I think Tim Russell saw this.
I don't know what's wrong with me.
If you've tried to get me to leave my house and I wouldn't, it's because I'm busy breaking plates, cutting glass and then gluing those bits and pieces to wood.
I'm making a vulture.
I take photos of everything and post just a fraction of them.
Since my last blog post (not related to Rock N Roll Armageddon) I have been up to the following:
Nico had surgery on Wednesday.
I stopped at Seaney Farms on my way to pick her up.
I bought the tastiest watermelon I've ever eaten from this place.
On Monday I went to Decatur and watched Moonrise Kingdom.
That movie was awesome.
You should go see it.
I also walked around downtown and talked to a crazy homeless guy, who supposedly had been in Decatur for one hour, arriving directly from New York.
He got on his knees begging for money, but would not accept food.
It was awkward.
My brother and his girlfriend spent the night Saturday and on Sunday we went to the Dana Thomas House.
I will definitely be visiting that place again soon.
Maybe even twice before the year's over.
It's that awesome.
We also went to Lincoln's neighborhood.
We did not go into the Lincoln home, but I did take a picture of it through a tube.
On Saturday, I woke up before five in the morning to ride with Jeff to deliver some artwork and prints and stuff to Crystal Lake, IL.
While there, we visited Bicycle Werks and they showed us the basement.
Here's my eyeball.
I really like this purple eyeshadow.
It's not something I'd normally wear.
Someone special-ordered it at Food Fantasies and then changed their mind.
It ended up on the discount shelf at 50% off so I bought it.
I've worn it every day since.
Here's me in my garden, holding Kohlrabi (which were both delicious!) next to tomatoes and in front of corn.
It's been a week and the corn is so much taller now!
If you want to know what's-what, see my last blog post where I give a one-minute garden tour.
It's barely light out unlike the beautiful bright sunny day happening right now, but I felt like making a video at that very moment.
Sure I could make a video at this very moment, but I want to take a picture instead.
I had my spleen removed when I was 15 because I had chronic Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP).
My dad donated blood a few days before the surgery so that if I needed a transfusion, I could use his blood instead of a stranger's.
We found out the day after he donated that our blood types were not compatible; he's B-negative and I'm O-positive.
Or so I thought.
Today I worked a health fair and the Central Illinois Community Blood Center was there and conducting blood-typing tests.
I wanted to see how the test worked so, even though I've known my blood type for a long time.... after spending a couple of years getting 1-3 blood tests a week, I know.
But it came up B-negative.
Twice.
Back when I had my splenectomy and my dad's blood was a different type, my mom and boyfriend-at-the-time both donated blood and both were a match.
If 38% of people are blood type O+ and 2% of people are B-
