If you are getting divorced, chances are you are concerned about your divorce settlement.
Your attention may be focused on what you will get in the settlement – which marital assets you hope to gain and possibly what kind of support you will receive or be ordered to pay.
But one area you might not have carefully considered is your marital debt and how that debt leaves your credit vulnerable, no matter what the divorce courts decide.
It is important that you understand what you owe, how the debt is going to be handled and your level of credit exposure.
What you might not realize is even if your divorce decree gives a debt to your ex-spouse and makes your ex-spouse accountable for paying it, divorce courts have no jurisdiction over creditors.
Most of the time, creditors do not care about the divorce settlement and agreement.
Ouch!
Your divorce and credit score stay married long after you do.
Divorce courts do not have the power to wipe out your obligations to lenders.
Credit cards, auto loans, mortgage companies and other debtors will hold you liable as long as your name is attached to the debt.
Even if the divorce settlement orders your ex-spouse to pay that debt, your credit is going to take a hit and you can be sued for the amount owed.
For added protection, you will want to add what’s called a “hold-harmless” clause for debts to your divorce settlement.
This clause allows the party who was not ordered liable, but has to pay because the legally responsible ex is not paying, go after their ex for the cost of back payments, damages, interest and attorneys’ fees.
When you are getting divorced, you have to protect your own best interests over the long run.
If you do not have a solid understanding of your credit obligations as they relate to the divorce settlement, you could create financial problems for yourself for years to come.
As a baby boomer woman, you probably have endured many joys and challenges during your life’s journey.
A dear friend of mine, Carrie E. Pierce opens her heart and shares her story of a loving relationship that ended abruptly and how she was able to heal herself by seeing the beauty of her wounds.
‘The wound is the place where the Light enters you.’
– Rumi
Four days before this past Christmas, Life delivered a kick to my gut that sent me reeling -on many levels- and drove me so hard to my knees; I struggled for two weeks before I could remotely regain my footing.
During this time, I was shaken to my very core.
Unable to eat or sleep, or find my way in the bleak blackness of it all, I began noticing a very strange phenomenon.
As I struggled through my days and nights, folks started coming out of the woodwork complimenting me.
‘You look great!’ ‘There’s so much Light in you!’ I’m a very private person, so these compliments came from folks who knew nothing about my loss, or the ensuing grief that threatened to consume me.
This got me thinking…
I recalled a picture of my Mom that had been taken approximately 2 months after the death of her first husband, when she was all of nineteen or twenty years old.
They had been married just three months when he was killed tragically in an Air Force jet crash.
That loss and the disasters that followed for my Mom were horrific- yet captured in that one particular photo- there on film for the entire world to see- the truest picture she has ever taken in her life.
Raw with unimaginable emotion and humanness, wrapped in an overcoat in the heart of winter, she stands, eyes swollen from the endless tears – a brave smile gently curving her lips ever so slightly upward, looking at the camera—looking Life in the eye, her Spirit exposed.
In this photo, she stands undaunted though handicapped, raw but full—very, very REAL.
And there it is: the light pouring forth from her wound.
As beauty is my industry, I’m expected to look good, no matter what.
I try never to disappoint, but the two weeks of grief made this difficult.
There were circles under my eyes, paleness from not being able to eat, fatigue from sleepless nights- all staring back at me from my bathroom mirror- but there ‘It’ was also: that Light…
An ethereal, not- of- this- world beam.
And it was spilling out of me, thru the cracks in my carefully crafted mask, the veneer I’ve created to encase me as I make my rounds in this world.
That very same veneer that now was smashed to bits.
Light- everywhere.
For those of you who read my articles regularly, or know of my career background, you know I lived and worked in Hollywood, and as such provided makeup services to film and TV celebrities.
You also know about my work providing reconstructive and restorative makeup services to burn and scar patients.
My idea of True Beauty is far from the superficial and I’ve always known that as human beings, we have scars- both the visible, external type- there for all the world to see, and the deeper, invisible type that so often haunts us without mercy- nonexistent to those people around us.
It can be debated which type causes the most pain.
But there is a new level of understanding for me now.
Technically, scars are made of fibrous tissue that replaces damaged skin after an injury.
The formation of a scar is a biological process of repair and as such is a natural part of the healing process.
Throughout my career, I’ve helped women- and men- cover their outer scars, and I’ve also worked with others in an attempt to help them balm their inner scars.
Both types bring horrific pain and anguish, and both offer a gift.
‘Some people see scars, and it is wounding they remember.
To me they are proof of the fact that there is healing.’―
Linda Hogan
In the years I’ve worked with women, I’ve dealt with scars from Domestic Violence, scars from cancer surgeries, scars from births by Caesarean Section, scars from plane crashes and resulting fires, scars from car wrecks, scars from deforming acne … and scars from crippling grief and despair.
I’ve known women who hated themselves because of their scars.
I’ve seen women unable to touch their mastectomy scars -and I’ve done everything within my power to help them learn to-at the very least- make peace with these fibrous reminders—and at the very best, embrace them as gifts.
Some are more willing to do this than others.
For each it is a journey of many emotions, many layers- many miles.
Be they physical scars or emotional, TLC is needed, and self-acceptance and self-love the only balm that will work to ease the pain, the tightness, the rawness.
Where we are the most broken, we are the most beautiful.
I believe this with all my heart and soul and I know this to be true.
Where we have been broken, we’ve been made pliable, where we’ve been burned, we’ve been laid bare, much like a forest after a raging fire… and from the ashes the hefty and fragrant regrowth comes- with time.
If the new year finds you aching, injured, marred or reeling please recall these words and then stare yourself in the eyes the next time you stand in front of your bathroom mirror.
You will find a beauty there that will take your breath away- and rightly so.
It is the beauty of YOU!
It’s always a wonderful moment when you and your partner realise that you want to save your marriage – suddenly, a whole new world of possibilities is open to you, and the past is forgotten.
You feel invincible; unbreakable – but don’t get ahead of yourselves.
Saving a marriage isn’t as simple as saying ‘bygones will be bygones’ and carrying on as normal.
It’s important that you and your partner immerse yourselves slowly back into your marriage – and the following tips can help to make sure that your commitment to each other is stronger than ever.
It sounds like a cliché, but taking a break to reassess your relationship is a brilliant idea.
However, try to choose something sedate; a holiday where you’ll have a large amount of privacy.
This would be an ideal way to get to know each other again, and iron out the minutiae of your reconciliation.
Avoid holidaying with mutual friends – it’s still too early for that – and if you’re both known for getting tetchy after a few drinks, avoid booze, no matter how good you’re feeling.
Make sure that the reasons you split up in the first place are fully sorted out.
It’s no good trusting in fate to make sure that everything turns out all right, or just trying to ‘forget about’ what caused your issues in the first place.
It might be painful, but it’s imperative that you both fully air your concerns, and talk through them until you’re both satisfied.
If one of you moved out during the split, don’t delay talking about your living arrangements.
Arguments will soon manifest themselves if one person is happy to move straight back in, but the other wants to take their time.
Don’t just assume that you should move back in together straight away, even if you’ve lived together for 20 years or more.
A new start means a new relationship, so have respect for each other’s boundaries.
Bear in mind that if your relationship fell apart because of work commitments, you will have to make some changes to your professional life if you want to ensure your marriage works.
If you’ve been working long hours and late nights during the split, your boss is probably used to relying on you, so make sure that they’re aware of your personal changes.
If your employer is less than impressed with your new circumstances, it might be worth looking for a new job – good marriages are hard to come by, whereas good jobs are relatively easy to find
Don’t expect too much.
Just because you’re back together, don’t assume that everything will be perfect forever after.
You will grow again; you will disagree over various things that used to bother you before the split.
Remember that you’re back together because you love each other – and that neither of you has any right to expect the other person to reinvent themselves.
Finally, remember to take the time to show your other half just how special they are – and continue to do so.
It’s no good showering them with affection for a few weeks after getting back together, then sliding back into old habits.
Remember how lucky you are to have each other, and never take the other person for granted.
If you can’t afford a restaurant once a fortnight, take a romantic walk, cook for them, or take them to the cinema.
Life is for living – and spending with the right person.
Are you still fighting with your ex-spouse even after years of being divorced?
- Are you aware that your children see, hear and feel the anger and tension between you and your ex-spouse a lot more than you realize?
After reading the stats below, I believe the high rate of divorce in our country has caught up with us.
From Experiments in Living: The Fatherless Family
For the best part of thirty years we have been conducting a vast experiment with the family, and now the results are in: the decline of the two-parent, married-couple family has resulted in poverty, ill-health, educational failure, unhappiness, anti-social behavior, isolation and social exclusion for thousands of women, men and children.
By Rebecca O’Neill; Sept. 2002, CIVITAS
Did you know children of divorce are?
• Twice as likely to drop out of school as those from intact homes*
• Three times as apt to have a baby out of wedlock*
• Five times more likely to be in poverty*
• Twelve times more likely to be incarcerated*
(McManus:Ethics & Religion Sept. 12, 2004 Column #1,203)
Other findings:
• Rates of child abused are eight to ten times higher in step/blended and sole families than in natural, two-parent families.*
• The sons of single parents are more prone to commit suicide as adults than others, and daughters are more likely to have abortions and more children.*
• When compared with people who grew up in a traditional family with both parents, children of single parents are hospitalized more often due to injuries and poisonings*.
• The sons of single parents also commit more crimes*
(*Helsinki Sanomat:”Children raised by single parents more prone to difficulties in adulthood.”

Enough is enough!
Things can be different!
During and after divorce, I feel both parents need to take responsibility for their own actions, stop pointing the finger at each other and get their act together.
Look in the mirror and ask yourself what do YOU need to do immediately to take charge of your own emotions and behavior.
There were times after my divorce that my emotions took over and I would become angry or bitter.
I realized this had to stop for the sake of my children.
That’s when I made the conscious decision to start working on my own personal growth.
I read everything I could get my hands on to change my old thinking patterns and to learn new life skills such as communication and coping skills.
That’s why today, my mission as a Certified Behavior Consultant is to support parents after divorce to improve communication skills to help turn “killer statements” into calm conversations and discussions and to learn the necessary listening skills to defuse misunderstanding, judgment and conflict.
For example, become aware of how you come across to others and learn how to deliver your message more effectively.
Who is the only person you can change?
What are you going to do TODAY to actively help create the best atmosphere of encouragement and cooperation to build your children’s confidence and self-esteem?
A few months ago I wrote a post entitled Remarriage after divorce works (June 2011).
I mentioned that my wife Clarissa and I were about to celebrate our four year wedding anniversary.
After being divorced in 2000 and remarried in 2007, I have to tell you that marriage the second time around is beautiful.
I am much wiser now when it comes to marriage and relationships in general as a result of going through a divorce.
As I encourage men and women now, I find myself approaching it from a different angle than I did just prior to being married.
The core principles of divorce recovery are the same: Acceptance of where you are, forgiveness of yourself and your former spouse, not jumping into a new relationship too soon, but I am also starting to get individuals to focus on being the best spouses they can be for their FUTURE husband or wife.
The approach I take now is this, instead of focusing so much on the negative things their former spouse said about them; I want people to focus on them in light of becoming a better person for themselves and their next relationship.
For example instead of asking: What do you need to work on to improve yourself?
I would say, what traits did your former spouse say that you had that you do not want to take into your next marriage?
The goal is to not only get them to improve themselves but to think about their future relationships as well.
The reason that I am using this approach now is because what I have noticed is that even though the divorce rate in this country is 50%, people are ashamed to talk about it.
The dreaded “D” word has become the scarlet letter in our society today.
It causes millions of people to not seek the help they need.
Joanie Winberg and I along with a team of others want to help individuals overcome this shame, and help put them on the track to becoming the husband or wife of their future spouse’s dreams!
We will be presenting some new and exciting news in a few weeks that will showcase to you how we plan to do this.
Stay tuned.
Remarriage after divorce does work.
I am living proof of that.
Clarissa and I love our marriage.
We know that with a few adjustments in your life, coupled with marrying the right person, you too can love your next marriage as well!
In discussing the end of relationships the other day, I started to remark on how I never understood how partners, once separated, could reconnect.
Of course I’ve heard of many divorced couples reuniting, and my young daughter’s favorite movie is the The Parent Trap, but for me and my experiences, the actual practice of reuniting after a breakup had been foreign.
This “point of no return” in relationships has been a marker of pride for my family of origin.
While my family name isn’t Hatfield or the McCoy’s – the idea is the same: you wrong me (or one in my family) and it will be remembered forever.
There’s no going back, there’s no re-building that burned bridge.
There is black and there is white – choose your side.
Growing up I’d seen this played out in many relationships as I sat around my family’s dining room table in regards to friends, acquaintances, and other relatives.
The scenario was always the same: someone did something wrong to a member of my family and that person was then demonized and removed from our lives.
This didn’t strike me as odd as it was all done in the name of “moving on”.
The choice was to stay back within the mucky bad place with the wrong-thinking person, or move-on (cue the birds singing) to the next better phase of life without that person.
When people are seen in this black or white way, it’s pretty easy to understand why I never got the “getting back together” thing.
Certainly my past relationships and exs would agree that I’ve walked this belief.
Friends that would join my family clan could clearly state the rule: don’t wrong a Kellner.
The consequences are permanent.
But in this recent conversation — as I started to state my dismay of a reuniting couple by declaring “Why, I never!” — I realized that actually, I had.
Huh… And my mind’s normal loop was suddenly cut.
I was no longer able to state this once-and-done attitude because, as I was just realizing, in my last relationship I actually got to practice end/start again/end/start again/end quite a few times.
Like any new practice, this experience wasn’t easy but the rewards with each new reuniting grew and, remarkably, the endings became smoother too.
In the final end, there were no bridges ablaze, just a quiet, respectful parting.
Sometimes the gift of a relationship takes a while to be seen.
In realizing the shift that occurred in me through this last relationship, I had to give up that claim which was so ingrained in me.
I hadn’t realized till that point, that “poof!”
I no longer could state shock-and-awe at hearing that a couple was reuniting.
Instead of going into pre-programmed reaction mode, I was left with the space of unfamiliarity.
Within this pause, I realized that my understanding had grown.
Just like that, decades of Being disappeared and I realized that I had created a new version of myself – one that allowed for people’s humaness (including my own) within love.
Through my experience of reuniting I let the stronger bond of love, not frustration or fear, guide the final decision.
I also discovered a new appreciation for the color gray.
Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony are getting divorced after 7 years of marriage.
The two have beautiful twins a boy and girl (Max and Emme) that unfortunately will be caught in the middle of their parent’s decision to end their marriage.
I am always saddened to hear of marriages that end, especially when children are involved.
I also often wonder what it is about Hollywood marriages that make them more susceptible to divorce.
Is it the glitz and glamour of the “Hollywood Scene”?
Is it the ego boost of adoring fans that gets you distracted from what is really important?
Is it the money and fame?
What is so sad about distractions is that they are only temporary.
The public is so fickle!
We will love you one minute and hate you the next.
It would truly be a tragedy to build your life around public opinion.
Whatever the case may be, we wish them the best.
My hope and prayer is that they will both do what is best for their children.
Hollywood or not, children are still children, and divorce is never good for them!
Should divorce and not marriage be obsolete?
This was the question that I asked my wife after we recently attended a three day marriage conference sponsored by the Association of Marriage and Family Ministries.
We learned so much that we can share with the couples that we sit down with weekly to help them strengthen their marriages.
However, in addition to these valuable tools, we also truly learned how many in society views marriage.
According to the conference sponsors a recent survey reported that 40% of Americans believe that marriage is obsolete.
I am not sure who conducted the survey or how large the sample size was, but even if the survey was small, this is an alarming thought to me.
To believe that people do not believe marriage matters.
I know that those of us that have been divorced hurt because of what we have gone through, but I still know that marriage not only matters, but it works.
Let’s not throw in the towel on marriage because of what is going on in this country.
50% percent of marriages don’t work!
That means that 50% percent do work!
Let’s learn what it takes to make marriage work and go for it.
That is what our E-Courses are all about.
The last thing that I want to leave you with is a quote I learned that came from self help guru Zig Ziglar on marriage.
This was his response when someone asked him whether or not they married the wrong person:
“ I have no way of knowing whether or not you married the wrong person, but I do know that many people have a lot of wrong ideas about marriage and what it takes to make that marriage happy and successful.
I’ll be the first to admit that it’s possible that you did marry the wrong person.
However, if you treat the wrong person like the right, you could well end up having married the right person after all.
