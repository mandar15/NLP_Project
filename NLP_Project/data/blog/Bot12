"Dan said:
Well, once, a philosopher (I forgot who exactly) said that a person cannot forgive unless she receives sincere apologies from the offender (or the person who did her wrong).
I am a person who gets angry very fast and let go even faster.
So I couldn't agree that one cannot forgive without apologies, but after I paid attention to what actually happens during that forgiveness process I realized that I actually never forgave those people, letting go is different from forgiveness, the first time that I really forgave someone was when I discussed my problem with him, and he was convinced that he was wrong and he truly apologized from the bottom of his heart, and I felt it, it's really an important moment because you feel relieved, it's like there was something very heavy on your heart and you throw it away."
This comment has given me insight regarding a subject that I have spent decades thinking about.
Yes I said decades.
The subject is forgiveness.
One point that Dan made is that "putting something aside" is not forgiveness.
I have always had difficulty with the concept of forgiveness.
It has always had a hollow sound to me.
Usually people would say "I will forgive but I won't forget".
In my mind that is not forgiveness.
I think about forgiveness like it is a folder on your computer with all of the various transgressions just a click away.
For me, a person that has really forgiven would delete the hard drive and a person would be given a new slate.
The second phrase that struck me in Dan's comments is when he described how forgiveness felt for him.
How a burden was lifted.
Unlike Dan I have a slow temper.....slow to start......longer to leave.
When I am wounded my reaction (I want you to note that I used the word react not respond) is primal.
If I have been deeply wounded the person loses both physical and emotional access to me.
If I am somewhat wounded I get on my emotional fence and I distance myself.
My fight or flight response is engaged.
I become more cautious and I am waiting to discern.
About 15 years ago someone took an axe to my heart.
He subsequently changed his mind and wanted to come back.
He tried for 7 years but there was a problem....He only remembered how good we were together and I only remembered the pain.
Dan's comment made me think about that relationship.
He would say to me "I'm sorry if I hurt you"  My reaction was intense it was if the person did not know that they hurt me.
It was if they were saying the words to appease me but there was no "there" there.
Where was the heart, I never could feel the heart  I just heard the words.
I recently had a converstation with a male co-worker.
We were talking about men and women.
He made the point that men do not know how to be vulnerable.
That when they are vulnerable they either become angry or violent.
Loving someone means that you become vulnerable to that person.
When I think abouot that relationship I realize that part of taking an axe to my heart was that he was afraid.
That fear made him destroy and fear made me run.
It turns out that fear was the underlying problem of our pain.
i was waiting for him to show me his heart and he never could.
Dan's words have given me insight and maybe a closer step to understanding forgiveness.
I know that I have not written for awhile.
Just busy with life.
I also did not have anything new to really write about.
I recently had a conversation with a friend that got me thinking about something new.
The conversation was short and like many conversations it followed many streams of thought.
My friend has recently retired and she was planning the new phase of her life.
If any of you have read any of my other posts I usually refer to life in its various seasons.
There is the spring season full of promise and growth, the summer where we are on our path, the fall a time of reflection and sometimes course correction and the winter.
I don't think of the winter season as an ending.....well yes it is an ending in some ways but it is also the beginning.
In our winter seasons we have fewer days ahead of us, so time becomes more precious.
My friend was talking about getting her life sorted out and putting things in place.
The idea of death becomes more real.
Now death can be a terrifying idea for some people.
I know that it is the one exit strategy that will be  part of all of our lives.
It is the opposite side of the coin of life   Well this conversation was not a morbid conversation.
Mostly we were talking about how much "stuff" one accumulates in life.
In our winter season you can drown in all of the things that you thought you "must" have and that you "need".
Only to find that the "must have" was really a very transitory moment in time.
The other thing that you realize is that mentally and emotionally you are not your chronological age.
You are stuck in some emotional time frame that is a different time, space and age.
Now some people feel very old when they are very young.
My friend felt older when she was young and now she feels younger when she is older.
Interesting what the mind does to our life.
Well.....back to our conversation.
In the discussion we talked about the paths of life that people take....whether good or bad.
Now I am not a good or bad thinking person   My friend looks at the paths that everyone has and believes that everyone has a good path and that they get sidetracked.
I think that every path is mixed iand there is good and bad within that path.
My friend thinks that there is only one path.
I on the other hand think that there are many paths in life.
So we had a lively conversation about the subject and I told my friend about my ephiany of death.
When I was in my spring season,  I had a dream.
I don't remember my age, what I remember is how the dream made me feel.
I have only had the dream once.
It was this dream that allows me to have a certain sense of peace with death.
I can explain the feeling of the dream.
In this dream I had a sense of "oneness" of knowing without trying to know.
I had an understanding that I was not alone and I did not have a need to be separate.
It was one of the most tranquil feelings that I have ever had in life.
Oh by the way....there were no drugs involved in my dream....just an aside.
When I awaken from my dream I understood that it was what life after death was like.
Now no one told me about this and I really don't talk about it but because of that dream I am calm about the end of my time on earth.
I will go to my exit in peace and curious about my path.
Well our conversation continued about the paths of life.
I told her that I believe that "God" is in all of us and that it is not about the external manifestation.
For me it is all about the internal.
It is the search for my spiritual center that motivates my life.
In our discussion she was saying to me then how does "God" allow for child abuse, and other horrific things that people do to each other.
In her worldview these people did not stay on the path of good and had strayed from the path.
In my mind all paths are mixed so I talked about how Nelson Mandela was in prison for all of those years.
It is my guess, since I don't know the man, that when he went to prison he was young and angry.
Filled with the anger of what had been done to his people.
It took years for him to discover the humanity of his captors.
In discovering their humanity some where he found forgiveness.
He found something that gave him wisdom.
Enough wisdom that instead of dividing his country he united his country.
Now I believe that this came at a great personal cost to him and to his family.
I have a theory that either we are in our own experience in life or we are the witness to someone else experience.
When we witness the experience of others we are given a gift.
if we choose to be fully present.
We are given knowledge without the experience.
If we can become observers of life the harsh things that others do can make us understand our own harshness.
If we are fortunate we can change.
I believe that Nelson Mandela's personal sacrfice inspired good in many others.
I also do not believe that we really know the meaning of our path until our exit.
Well this conversation made me think about something that has always puzzled me.,,,forgiveness.
If you have read my post on forgiveness you know that it is something that I don't know how to do.
So I thought about my conversation with my friend, and I thought about Nelson Mandela how he had to understand the humanity of his enemy and it made me think about forgiveness.
So I will ruminate about that subject again.
Stay tune something new is bubbling inside.
I have been watching the news and observing how Congress is behaving.
I have also been observing the different scandals that have been erupting.
It is curious to me because a lot of these scandals are done by those in power.
There has been movement from those that are looking for consensus in the political arena to those that just want power.
Whether this is personal power, political power, financial power there is something in common with those that are in the pursuit of power.
There is the assumption that "they" hold the answers.
There is also a one up one down position in which the person that is one down is not considered as important or valuable as the person that is on top.
Individuals in power seem to have a disregard for the value of others with a sense of entitlement for themselves.
Their abuses, when publicly exposed, violate the trust of their positions and makes their behavior even more reprehensible.
When public trust is violated there is an outrage of accusations and blame.
It is my guess that those that seek to have private power, over those that they say they love, don't have the public shame but share in the private destruction of those that they have wounded
In my mind, destruction is destruction, whether it is private or public.
Unfortunately, what are we to expect when the social mores of society have shifted to move from what is good for the majority to a psychological frenzy of sharks going after a piece of meat.
The looking for a meaningful existence is somehow devalued.
The only thing that appears to be of value is the carcass of humanity.
What happens to the victor when they realize they have nothing left but the empty shell of humanity.
Wouldn't it be great if politics did not exist.
If the underbelly of society, culture,government,jobs and family did not involve the back door working of the game.
Now I say this understanding that it is a dream of mine that will never be realized.
Politics are involved in every aspect of human nature.
It would be naive of me to believe that I just had to be a hard working individual, keep my nose clean and that I would somehow be rewarded for being a good "Girl Scout" .
Alas politics is even in the bedroom you have to be careful of what you say, how you say it, who you say it to and why and even with all of that you will still probably do something wrong.
Maybe politics is just the jocking for position within our primate groups.
We have gone from the physical jocking for power to the mental jocking for power.
It is a way to demonstrate who is on top.
I think that politics, unless you are one of those rare humans that politics is your natural strength, moves us away from being authenticate.
It may also civilize us that by the very nature of political compromise, we must compromise.
So instead of the wild, wild west shoot outs we get together and we cut deals, stab people in the back, all in the name of the common good.
Whether it is gender politics or otherwise known......how to keep a good woman down.....or company politics....should the most qualified person get the job....or....the one that I like....trust....or who will do what I tell them to do.....should get the job.
All politics cause me to be frustrated.
I understand the why but just because I understand the why doesn't mean that I have to like politics.
Oh well, enough of my rant.......let the games begin.
I have been in a transition this year.
I have three friends that visit me whenever I am in a transition.
Woe is Me, Life Sucks and Why Me Lord.
Now these friends and I have very long conversations with each other.
They are mostly telling me about what not to do or what I can't do or why even try.
One of the first signs that they are visiting is that I start losing interest in people, places and things.
Matter fact, the most important thing that they tell me is that I can't let anyone know that they are visiting.
So, I go about my day and my three friends are always waiting for me throughout the day.
Now Woe is Me usually has me feeling quite sorry for myself.
My friend Woe and I talk about the unfairness of life and how others have it so much easier than I.
Why Me Lord continues on the same vein but that friend wails about the unfairness and has a much louder voice.
Life sucks now that is the most dangerous of my three friends because that friend blinds me to the beauty of life and all of its possiblities.
Life Sucks takes me to the dark areas of my life and tells me about all of my failures.
Now I have had enough transitions in my life so that I should be able to recognize these friends when they show up........but I don't.
They sneak up on me and then one day I realize that they are all sitting in my life.
One of the first things that these friends do is take the pleasure out of life.
Life stops being fun.
My life is full of the distractions of work so it is easy to find myself very busy without even realizing that they are visiting.
Sometimes I start having trouble sleeping because my friends want to keep me up all night.
Life Sucks spoils any of the positive thoughts that I have about people, places and things and tells me that I just need my three friends and i don't need anyone else.
My three friends hide behind my facade of efficiency and work.
They keep me busy on the outside, while the inside is in turmoil.
Well you will be happy to know that i have told my three friends that they have to leave my life.
They did not go happily.
They like visiting me but I don't like them.
I have started my new transition and there is not any space in my life for them.
My cocoon has fallen and I am now a new  butterfly.
When I was in my summer season of life I interviewed with IBM for a sales position.
One  of the questions that I was asked was "what is the difference between rejection and refusal".
My response was that rejection was something that was personal and refusal was just not wanting what was being offered.
I think that it is easy to confuse the two in life because both may make you feel bad.
Your self esteem takes a blow.
For a minute, lets take a look at the difference between the two.
If I tell you no and you believe that it is because I don't like you or don't want what you have to offer, what does that really mean.
In business it is mostly a refusal, there can be a lot of reasons or circumstances as to why you were told no.
Sometimes in business it is personal but mostly it just feels personal in business.
If you have ever worked in sales, if you take every "no" as a rejection you will become too sad to even think about selling.
It would bruise your spirit so that the idea of "asking " for the sale would become unbearable.
Now the feeling of rejection is always personal.
The intent of the other person may or may not be personal.
In life, I have had been loved and I have not been able to return that love.
I know that the person may have felt rejected but for me it was a refusal.
I was just saying "no".
It didn't mean that the person wasn't worthy.
Sometimes it was really all about me.
I wasn't ready, the timing wasn't right, the path wasn't clear for me to see us together.
I have also been on the opposite end of the stick where I have loved and the love was not returned.
I felt very rejected.
In retrospect what I realized that the "fit" between that person and myself wasn't there.
Sometimes when I have strong feelings I can become blind to the obvious.
My rational mind goes out the window and I just become emotionally obtuse to the facts.
I have learned, in my life, that everyone gets to say "no".
That someone's "no" may just be what you need to move you to a better path.
I didn't get that job with IBM but I did get a sales job that was a better fit for my lifestyle.
That initial question is something that I have always asked myself, when I am feeling dejected.
I have to remind myself that people have the right to say no and you have the right to determine whether you want to make this an opportunity to grow or do you want to feel sad.
After all it is your life.
I recently had a conversation with someone who told me that finding a man was very difficult.
What I said to her was that finding a man is easy, when you are ready.
The key to that statement is "when you are ready".
