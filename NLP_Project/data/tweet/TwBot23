I am for the Revision of the Cybercrime Act.  think of meeeee.... Think of me fondly when we've said goooodbyyye!! One of my fave plays ever!!! 
An act that takes away a citizen's freedom & right to hear/read/tweet/retweet/blog/post/like about the good & bad things about our country  Let's Unite as one against hunger. 12 Hour Famine. September 29, 2012 The Skydome at SM North Edsa. Follo  
We want peace in our country, amongst our people & future generations.  Follow and visit their website  for updates and find out how you can join us! :) 
& we should all have equal rights. I just feel its so one sided. I hope they consider REVISING the crybercrime act.  Sign up & register for P350.00 and join the fight against hunger. Your 12 hours of hunger will be able to feed a child. 
Even if I know that as a celebrity I'd probably even benefit from the act but at the end of the day i'm still a citizen of this country  Do you want to be a hunger-fighter?  Join us on September 29, 2012 for the 12 hour Famine at the SM North Skydome. 
BUT going to extent of having a law that takes away a freedom we should all rightfully have just seems wrong to me.  I believe that too! “@curt04: I believe na lahat ay marunong kumanta, nasa attitude lang -Louie Ocampo” 
The cybercrime act does have some responsible points that should be included & implemented BUT  I actually like a lot of Drake's song! Been a looooooooong time since I likes anything hiphop/r&b. 
And now if we share our opinions we can get into trouble with the law? Put behind bars? Fined a ridiculous amount even?  Yey! My diet arrived! Dieting for beach scenes start tomorrow! :) 
Whatever happened to Freedom of speech? Having an opinion? Expressing oneself? These are our own accounts. Our property. Our lives.  Ok enough of that. hahaha. Time to start getting ready for shooting... and dinner with the boy :)
