he already made me a peace ambassador. So it's my duty to make a stand when it goes exactly what we're aiming for. 
I'm afraid will do the complete opposite. 

I am for the Revision of the Cybercrime Act. 
An act that takes away a citizen's freedom & right to hear/read/tweet/retweet/blog/post/like about the good & bad things about our country 
We want peace in our country, amongst our people & future generations. 
& we should all have equal rights. I just feel its so one sided. I hope they consider REVISING the crybercrime act. 
Even if I know that as a celebrity I'd probably even benefit from the act but at the end of the day i'm still a citizen of this country 
BUT going to extent of having a law that takes away a freedom we should all rightfully have just seems wrong to me. 
The cybercrime act does have some responsible points that should be included & implemented BUT 
And now if we share our opinions we can get into trouble with the law? Put behind bars? Fined a ridiculous amount even? 
Whatever happened to Freedom of speech? Having an opinion? Expressing oneself? These are our own accounts. Our property. Our lives. 
Being someone thats active in the Social Media world I couldn't help but feel sad & scared while reading the Cybercrime Act. 
Good Morning! It's a rainy Wednesday! Keep dry and safe everyone! 
With my boys. Who is who? hahahaha

Let's hope that if mining does happen in our country it's not where it hurts the Philippines Biodiversity. Taamaa? 
what happens when there's nothing left to mine? The Philippines can only take so much :( 
Thats where I stand. Just don't mine in places like Palawan or parts of the Philippines that are too beautiful to be destroyed. Such a waste 
-the beauty of our country.Greenland, forests, rivers, coral reefs, livelihood of fisherman are being destroyed. Cant they choose elsewhere? 
I get that it can help our country somehow financially blah blah blah but if it is supervised mining why choose areas where it would ruin-- 
if its supervised mining why choose places where it would hit our country where it hurts most? 
Yes!Exactly! “@youQhUOTEme: have you watched this video?  the girl who silenced the world for 5minutes” 
If ever supervised mining I'm sure they can choose or find other places where our beautiful country won't be so affected. So sad! 
Hi Tita! It's just so sad that's it's in places that we're promoting for our tourism. Such beautiful forest lands put to waste. :( 
YOU! My 3M+fellow dreamers, WE can make a difference. Use our voices. Ang dami natin! Let's dream BIG together that WE can STOP the mining! 
Let's protect the place we call HOME. Visit the website  SIGN UP!!! 
Use your voice. Join me and make a stand for our beautiful islands and beautiful people, the farmers & fishermen & their families. 
We have a voice. We can make a stand. I know I will. Say no to mining in Palawan or better yet say NO to mining in the PHILIPPINES. 
I'm sure there are more videos I haven't seen yet but I'm just so devastated to see what has happened already. Here.  
Isn't it supposed to be MORE fun in the Philippines? How can it be more fun if we allow the beauty of our country to be taken away from us? 
Was able to stumble upon a video of the mining that IS currently going on the lovely islands of the Philippines.
