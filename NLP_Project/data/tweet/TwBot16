xxxxx 
thanks doll x 
love back at you sibbers xxxx 
Im from a working class family and have worked hard to get to where i am today. Others will just sit and do nothing but judge. 
Thanks for your nice tweets guys! I was bullied at school so there's no way im having it again as a grown woman. 
xxxxxxx 
thank you babes xxx 
right this is what im talking about. YOU=bully. Take a look at yourself. I have been working nonstop for 15 years thank you 
On todays show RIta Ora singing live from the Hackney academy #radio1 
Good vibes and happiness all round. 
Im a postive person who believes in treating people kindly. I dont understnad the mentality of others who think differently. 
Grown men who slag me off in articles/online are huge bullies. I love my job and wouldnt be doing it if i wasnt any good at it. 
People who sit lazily and judge others will never grow. They'll never take a look at themselves or feel content. Shame so many do.
