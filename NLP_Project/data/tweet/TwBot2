he says he should be back soon which is excellent. in your short list of one of the nice guys on tour?  remember voting is still open for the crossword popular awards. you can vote for your favourite book at   #mycricketmyvoice don't know if darren bravo will make the 11 actually. 
a very fine commentator & really good man,robin jackman,has been diagnosed with cancer.he says they found it early which is excellent.  you can get #thewinningway as a download from amazon kindle.  #mycricketmyvoice would have shortlisted ojha,uthappa & karthik & asked captain who he was most comfortable with 
apparently the india v pakistan game at edgbaston during the champions trophy next june is sold out within 3 hours of tickets opening!  thanks anupam,had fun writing it  #mycricketmyvoice wickets won't be that bad but most teams are well travelled now. should cope 
nice. time to get back?  i love doing test matches and am hoping to do the england series  #mycricketmyvoice yes i think most teams will have at least two spinners 
absolutely. sometimes by being a critic, you are actually being a friend  thanks glad you liked it  #mycricketmyvoice me shreya? no! very happy to do commentary on as many games as i can. 
funny i don't know what you do for a living!! but you have a rare gift of getting people to talk. look forward to more.  change is not an enemy, merely a challenge to set ways of doing things; forces us to get out of our comfort zone. #thewinningway  #mycricketmyvoice don't think awana had done to be selected but definitely needs more encouragement with 'a' tours 
funny, i did exactly the opposite and still had a great start.  yes it's good when that happens sometimes  #mycricketmyvoice i would definitely have had a 2nd wk in the squad; someone good enough to bat in top 7 
do read this  to understand the thoughts of an independent writer. don't always agree with gideon but respect his views  one of the reasons the west indies have always been so popular is that they bring joy. there is no rancour to their cricket  #mycricketmvoice i hope rohit has a good world t20. in form he is a tremendous sight and a matchwinner 
thank you very much for your messages. i read all of them. apologies for not being able to respond to all of them.  i really do hope we don't get a crumbly, powdery pitch for the final. we need a good cricket match.  #mycricketmyvoice bit suspicious of it at the moment! but quite like the idea of leagues and a world cup 
ha konachahi pathimba nahi.....mool prashna.  everyone said the aussies couldn't win if they were 10-2. guess they were right. but astonished by the collapse.  #mycricketmyvoice don't think so,still love a good odi. t20 more concentrated action 
my friend talks about having so many more memories to make. isn't that a beautiful thought?  it might well be "badrinarayan" for the west indies today!  #mycricketmyvoice india's fast bowling is a worry, especially at this icc world t20 
am overjoyed to hear you say "and so many more to make". and am certain that is the message you spread in your talks.  if australia win this you will have had the most astonishing 20 overs ahead...and it will need poor bowling to allow that  #mycricketmyvoice yes great line....anything else you think fits into that sentiment? 
does being a terrorist automatically mean your iq cannot match that of a spiritualist? is iq determined by choices or is it more innate?  the word "boundary" once signified a barrier. in cricket it was an accomplishment to go past it....  #mycricketmyvoice expect wickets to be flatter post slpl if weather allows. 160 should produce good games 
i remember george well....perth 1992.....have we been around that long glenn?  dear #icc, those implements gayle & pollard were wielding, can you give them another name? "bat" is what vvs laxman and mark waugh used.  #mycricketmyvoice many.malinga,hafeez, ajmal, ashwin, morkel... 
thanks radhika.  they talk of a spirit of nationalism to sri lankan cricket. is this why?   #mycricketmyvoice would seem slow bowling key at this stage but will depend on tracks 
that's tame ajay!  interesting thought from scyld berry  can a batsman physcially exhausted be allowed to "retire"? good comments below too  #mycricketmyvoice no clue, think it will benefit indian players too. can see pujara and kohli gaining 
wow, cannot believe so many on this forum....deeply moving... just over 3 years... many friends, many critics, none blocked.  "goals should always be slightly out of reach but never out of sight" #thewinningway  #mycricketmyvoice traditionally that is how it has been. but can understand need for standard length 
at bengaluru airport, boarding shortly!  thank you. enjoyed doing it. cheers  #mycricketmyvoice ah, too many to remember but some with sachin were delightful 
but what's with the travel in bengaluru? 2 hrs and 10 mins to the infosys campus but zipped back in 1 hr 40 mins!  yes indeed  #mycricketmyvoice this t20wc will be very closely watched to see impact of various leagues 
dr balaram is gentle, dignified, succinct and, needless to say, very knowledgeable. have become a fan of a scientist.  for my understanding...what do people think about putting a memorial to bhindranwale & photographs of "martyrs" inside the golden temple?  #mycricketmyvoice think emotional decision but will know how fit he is on 8th when he plays t20 vs nz 
lovely day in bengaluru. privilege meeting mr narayana murthy and dr balaram, head of iisc. talking of whether scientists need to be icons  latest article. what do you think?   #mycricketmyvoice team already picked! but none of the under 19s contenders 
there is a copy of "who let the dork out"next to me. unless the guy next to it is you!!  only because it can be misused. it is not a limitation that will change the game too much.  #mycricketmyvoice pakistan, australia and dark horse, the west indies 
but it addresses the concerns about stripping him of his titles  if the designated captain for the tournament in the team,he should always be captain; this has been thought of for a long time  #mycricketmyvoice in the immediate future odi world cup will have greater prestige,this t20wc will give a pointer 
fair call. my book was written in 1993-94; way before any allegations surfaced  jayawardene man of the match? batted superbly but herath?  by the way your tweets need to have #mycricketmyvoice because that is what i am accessing 
thanks to for this link to the strong defence of lance armstrong by sally jenkins   further proof of the importance of a good all-round bowling side. pakistan have a lot of work to do on their batting.  #mycricketmyvoice looking forward to more questions on the icc world t20 
in all this talk about lance armstrong,wonder what sally jenkins,who actually wrote the magnificent prose in 'it's not about the bike' feels  pakistan have converted a decent sri lankan score into a match winning one. but very well bowled sri lanka.  #mycricketmyvoice ideally a conversation between player and mgmt. but final verdict always with selectors 
a fine writer (vic marks) on 3 great cricketers (tendulkar, ponting, kallis)   sri lanka bowling really well but putting up one of their worst fielding performances. not just catches but run-outs and misfields all over  #mycricketmyvoice if not banned certainly kept away from test cricket for a while 
not sure of the adjective but thanks nonetheless!!!  sri lanka's balance will be handy here. expecting more seam today. just a hunch.  #mycricketmyvoice no i think that train has left the station 
had an excellent with at the iitb-school of management talking of #thewinningway.  good last over for sri lanka but doesn't change my opinion of gul. 140 something to play with it but 15 short i fear. batting order?  #mycricketmyvoice love all forms. relish test cricket & enjoy t20 too. as long as contest between bat & ball 
on holmes, deduction, big data and cinema!!   more worry for sri lanka? ajmal using a towel......  #mycricketmyvoice players go and players come. that is the way of life. already pujara and kohli here 
will do. sounds interesting  that's the importance of a good bowling side. umar gul best end overs bowler now....one to go  #mycricketmyvoice orange ball, i'm told, is the way ahead for night cricket. has been trialled 
still getting worked up with wicked replies?  i hope for their sake sri lanka are playing this right. mathews surely?  #mycricketmyvoice very good i think. maybe the bowling a bit weak but slow wickets should help 
very elegant and sharp from navtej sarna on naipaul   if dilshan had played the aggressor, sangakkara could have played his normal game. that combination would have been better for sri lanka  #mycricketmyvoice i think that is upto state assocations. that is where the growth comes from. 
not at all. thank you!  pakistan will hope the pitch eases up later in the evening. has tended to do that. sri lanka need 160  #mycricketmyvoice yes i think harmeet should have played more by now. but this will be a big season for him 
how did you know?  completely inexplicable this from dilshan. off spinners bowling...he should be taking the lead. putting pressure on other batsmen  #mycricketmyvoice the success of ball follow technology depends largely on quality of equipment used 
interesting learning initiative from & Deltecs Infotech.   chala....tithe pan kathin shabda!! no photographs of the buffet? seriously, must chat about these issues someday.  #mycricketmyvoice many. leeds test 02, perth 08, natwest 02, t20 wc 07....many more 
i am only one of the people it is more than me  looks like an interesting afternoon....unless you are only pulling out the interesting bits!  i hope not. looking forward to meeting him in sri lanka #mycricketmyvoice 
so will fans in ahmedabad cheer for samit bhai?  was also lucky to spend half an hour chatting with gary kirsten on his approach to coaching and managing people.  #mycricketmyvoice i certainly hope so and the girls deserve it greatly. some of them are really good 
just checked with apparently steve smith can re-sign with pune warriors. there is a deadline. it was a technical issue.  good to see the matter resolved. spent some time with him in colombo and found him very agreeable.  because they suddenly start playing a higher level of cricket and only some can cope 
absolutely...and most deservingly too. you guys had to be there.  chatting with ian chappell and david hopps on the icc world t20   online now for the #mycricketmyvoice responses so keep them coming. will handle as many as possible 
yes it was.  sport is an emotional activity and it is absolutely fine to show your emotions  the smaller the game the less predictable it is. teams that handle less pace well will stand a better chance 
you still believe that story?  that happens too! in a good mood today?  nice. pithy and appropriate. 
even though the bowling wasn't, sachin's century should give him the time in the middle and the confidence he needed.  no, those were the matches i was allotted!  hopps is right.strauss is a decent dignified man who always did what was right.critical aspect of leadership.is respected around the world 
anytime.hope you enjoyed it.  so time to say goodbye to colombo and the really nice time i had at the worldt20. cricket good, weather held.....  excellent piece from a writer who is always a good read. hopps on strauss.  
lovely time today. you were brilliant. thanks.  good to know you were watching some other game!!  don't forget to make a statement on #MyCricketMyVoice to 3 today. will retweet some & answer some after that. 
absolutely lovely time at the jaguar castrol event with alastair cook, sourav ganguly & lots of gyaan & much fun.  thanks brian.....was fun. hope it is a great last three days  thank you. hope kerry can make it to india, will be searching for some chillies for him! 
it will happen this year. already sanjay manjrekar has been at the duleep final  since you have stopped being rude, here. pak's bad game against india, india's against oz and australia's against pak.  listen the awards were for calendar year 2011!!! 
well spotted!  each of them had one bad game. thought that was easy to understand. turns out wasn't for some!  and good to see sachin come up to present the lifetime achievement award to ajit wadekar. #castrolcricket 
excellent ranji trophy updates   yes!  ashwin got his from eas prasanna. said he had spotted prasanna and hoped he would get the award from him. #castrolcricket 
excellent from all media on coverage of the ranji trophy. shows what happens if the best players play. should make it happen more often  because he is talking about the super 8s, not today. need to read thro!!  virat kohli presented young cricketer award to unmukt chand; really nice conversation between 2 u19 wc captains. #castrolcricket 
that isn't entirely correct.we were asked 'dhoni or ganguly'.my answer was i would like to include tiger pataudi in that list  really did!! blew my mind. serious!  of course i would ian...if i am competent enough, yes. 
you didn't have to say it glenn....you might have found a way into the records!  not easy nikhil. there were 907 responses when i got back from the game. now 100. but read thro all of them.  odi player of the year suresh raina, test player of the year dravid. spl achievement awards to gambhir, kohli #castrolcricket 
by the way for all you espn school quiz lovers told me he missed making the psbb team by 2 marks!  got fair bit of flak today for being "fair" & "neutral" (not my words) would be very happy to get that every day.viewers all round the world  such a nice warm evening of cricket at the #castrolcricket awards 2011. cricketer of the year was ms dhoni. batsman sachin & bowler ashwin 
nice one....pity about the joey barton being cool though!!  3 of the 4 best bowling sides are in the semi-final. for a game that everyone had condemned as a batsman-only game, that's not bad!  along with the icc have created a hash tag to promote t20wc #mycricketmyvoice. will reply to tweets & retweet some  
yes but that suggests he is not robust in the first place.  australia had a very bad game. pakistan had a very bad game. and india had a very bad game. sometimes it goes your way, sometimes doesn't.  these awards #castrolcricket are for the year 2011 
why is something "in" a paper but "on" the net? "in" the movie but "on" television. any english teachers there?  the moment india had to win by 32, it was clear the semi-final was gone. you couldn't make 180 on that. it was that australia game!  why don't you reply with #castrolcricket and let's see what they make of your choice. will be back tonight to tell you 
latest article in indian express / cricinfo   one of those days when every hunch is right. have seen australia go down on such pitches before. always thought 149 was enough.  have been hosting the #castrolcricket awards since 1997-98. seen rahul dravid win in 5 times and sachin 6 times. tonight? 
but greg, if your back goes bowling 4 overs, wouldn't it have gone bowling 20?  absolutely not. the switch hit cannot be allowed. it is unfair to the bowler  just heading off to host the #castrolcricket awards. waiting to see who will be cricketer of the year 
if you noticed i am not against home conditions...only against one-sided pitches  if pakistan bowl decently, 149 is not a bad score  am sure you've heard of reincarnation lawrence! 
brilliant from vvs laxman to lead hyderabad which has been struggling in recent times in the ranji trophy. true commitment to indian cricket  just heard what jaiswal said about wives. and his equally bad clarification. imperative that we show we are angry.  no he is from isi cal. and is very proud of it 
what a nice, pithy build up to the ranji season from sid monga   pakistan showing up australia's bowling a bit. won't be surprised if hilfenhaus or mckay come in for hogg next game  delighted to be part of a seriously good panel of commentators for the icc world t20 and looking forward to meeting many old friends. 
why don't you check out #thewinningway ? there is that and a lot more in it  hope that doesn't mean rain later!  of course i do! 
i am doing the india-england series , i am not aware of any revenge series.  which rate? they need to get a score that will allow them to win first. their problem has been early wickets.  that is why i have never rated wikipedia as a source of knowledge. it was my wife who went to iit-b then iim-a 
mind now moving towards test cricket. very excited to be doing indian cricket tests in india after a long time.  with wickets in hand, pakistan should be good to get at least 150 here. good match in prospect.  as far as i remember the only facebook page i am on is the one that relates to #thewinningway 
to find out why some players are retained and others left out will need to know which of them were replacements.  unusual from australia here. dropped jamshed early, now a bit sloppy in the field. this is not a bad base for pakistan at all!  no, wouldn't dream of it 
had expected some franchises to offload expensive players.but they're obviously concerned about being able to get good indian replacements  if good people like jayawardene have to go around the law you need to relook the law. sidetracking it could mean 11 different captains  no, wouldn't dream of it 
he's not there yet but needs to be encouraged  the idea behind fining captains for over-rates is to get 20 overs in. changing captains implies you don't care too much about it.  did chemical engineering but know nothing about iit-bombay. wasn't good enough to get there. 
time to check weight on a daily basis lawrence!  just got this. seems very worthy of support with rahul dravid backing it.   yes i'm proud to say he is a dear friend of mine 
there is a feeling among some in india that he might just be the best player of spin in the england team  west indies need to sort their bowling. looking alarmingly thin. way too dependant on narine with ball and gayle with bat.  oh dear, this is embarrassing now. never been on gmail either! 
at the mumbai lit fest in a couple of days talking about dearth of cricket biographies. interesting topic.enjoyed writing one many years ago  england will be 1st to admit that on paper they were a good side. but much like ours, their young players need to play in other conditions  it was directed by roye segal who was outstanding 
seems my views similar to yours.....writing article tomorrow!  working together for more than 15 years?  indeed! all well thanks. just very busy! 
so were all of us niall hence baffled. looked up report to see if there was an injury.  thanks ashok.  it did iim-a it gave me great confidence and even today gives me a sense of peace 
thanks xavier. trust it wasn't a very short flight!  no class system in a commentary box!  no am not on myspace either unless someone has opened an account for me. have never been there 
with just 8 overs for awana today the message going out to young quicks is: stop wasting your time trying to be a fast bowler.  sorry but had got it from somewhere else...then saw your tweet  no i am not on google plus unless being on twitter automatically does it. 1st time i've been to that page just now. 
the tragedy of today's cricket v england was that parwinder awana bowled 8 overs, raina and yuvraj between them bowled 32  of course we should have thought of it....jayawardene on an over-rate warning, isn't he?  so now all you need to tell me is that eating chocolate need not induce guilt! 
he's no 6, bowling an asset on turning tracks....need to be convinced about batting first....do think.  that's a first for me.captain not coming out for the toss! they lost it anyway!  no i'm not on linkedin. not on facebook either. 
yes ...that,,, and basic profit and loss accounting!  if samuels was the key bowler why didn't he bowl earlier?  interesting....would berdych and isner be competing for no 1 on the tennis rankings? 
as points out realignment of players might also be to create room for players from pakistan...if the decks are cleared on that one  love the way tv anchors call sangakkara "sanga" and rahul dravid "jammy". best friends?  so that's a second popular perception you are attacking! after the cashews! 
could well be...especially with the govt giving a go ahead to the pak mini-tour.  many many things you can't understand: not narine but samuels last over? 125 kmph with virtually no run-up? best fielders materialising?  and hoping the much awaited rain in mumbai doesn't affect flights. hope the lakes are filling up! 
it does, absolutely.....  must confess to being disappointed with the west indies. whatever happens today proving that even in t20 you need genuine class  saying goodbye to chiangmai after an excellent time taking #thewinningway to bmc software. but waiting to be home 
and honestly, if they have had the opportunity that is not a bad thing....corporate selectors with a different mindset  ....and when you play for glory, almost inevitably, the bank is happy.  wadekar for lifetime achievement and unmukt for emerging player already announced #castrolawards. been associated since day 1....1998!! 
seems like franchises are letting go lot of expensive players with sub-optimal returns   in the ryder cup very rich golfers play for no money. the power of glory always greater than the power of the bank.  back to cricket from tomorrow morning. time out at cricinfo and then to bengaluru for #castrolawards. 
today last day for extension of player contracts by ipl teams. all contracts were 2yrs+1yr (option of renewing or otherwise with franchise)  "We must never underestimate the power of belonging to a group" on the ryder cup. often feel that way about television too  there is a reality and humility about theatre that appeals enormously to me in an era of paid pr and tons of fluff. 
another of the many books i have read a part of......  just watched challa from jthj. nice and peppy. but do you now have to understand punjabi to watch hindi films? #justasking  am still in awe of naseeruddin shah on stage and one of the finest performances i have ever seen came from in i'm not bajirao 
thank you very much for your responses. have made notes. nice to be able to reach out.  sirf cricket match to hai yeh! kal ek aur din hai  serious followers of hindi cinema: is theatre contributing to indian movies still? is the next generation game to be live on stage.... 
isn't it fantastic that a call for ideas on how to make role models of scientists got as many responses as a tweet on the epl! some hope!  am hardly the mysterious kind!!  will be interesting to see how much the leftists in theatre contributed to indian cinema. hangal, utpal dutt, balraj sahni, kaifi azmi... 
excellent. maybe mandatory reading in school. that's a very nice idea. scientists have to be able to communicate interestingly.  my view from the other side to pakistan fans: umar akmal at 4 everytime, maybe even shoaib malik at 3. and quite impressed with raza hasan  you must have done something right then.... 
ah, just took the spelling from the cricinfo scorecard! that poster any use?  the two shots i remember the most though were the cuts he played from off stump off a bowler like ajmal #kohli  : well done. missed most of the bowling since away but caught an excellent cover drive before i left! 
one of my father's proudest possessions:a book autographed by linus pauling; told us about bohr, lavoisier, (cont)   you know you are watching a special player when you remember all the shots. the cover drive early on, the lofted drive off the fast bowler..  always enjoy chatting with venkat. tells it as it is. but enjoys those extra firm handshakes! 
any thoughts on how to recognise scientists & give them their due? is it that the only "stars" are those that seek to be in the media?  in limited overs cricket kohli is producing the kind of innings that made you say 'wah sachin'.  i can imagine!! ls tells some stories too! 
overjoyed.email from mr narayana murthy inviting me to a discussion:how to make scientists role models for indian youth: necessary debate  two great rivalries produced two one-sided cricket matches. but watching shane watson and virat kohli is such joy.  for kkr fans from  
looks like yuvraj bowling himself into the test team with wickets of kp and bell!  so off to the ground for a two game day. on air 1515. hopefully two great cricket matches. focussing on cricket,no tweets till back!  ah, my reputation precedes me!! but, seriously.... 
will probably be prettier than most!  "a learner for life" and a follower of that's two nice things!  looking at bowling figures...murali not danger any more? next gen aussies not matchwinners at this level? 
what kind of surface are they playing on in guanggong? india women 81(20overs) pakistan women 46/6 (15overs)?  brilliant ambesh. thanks for sharing. on a cricket day enjoyed something from a much wider world!  fair point 
AD thinks this is the best SA attack he has seen. compare to himself, pollock, ntini, kallis, klusener, you/adams?  ah, osman...isn't that such a friendly and pleasant mix of blue and green! the colours of cricket!  thanks! was scared of being in that company!! 
doesn't matter, different roles. it is how well you can communicate and how professional you are that matters  "And now go, and make interesting mistakes, make amazing mistakes, make glorious and fantastic mistakes. Leave (cont)   haven't seen enough to have an opinion. but in general best to see them at a higher level 
it is always good to see that your thoughts are in sync with someone who has packaged sport better than most.  the gatekeepers are leaving their gates: what a line! this and more   you think he must have run into his temper at some point!!! 
hill believes a good cricketer-commentator should enter the mind of the captain / bowler and explain likely thoughts to the viewer.  that was a warm up game. ind and pak have only played twice at the world t20; both in 2007  nice from george binoy about unmukt chand  
very happy to hear hill's pt of view on keeping the lay viewer in mind. too much commentary he thinks assumes viewer knowledge.  the investment isn't the issue, the skill is!  to be honest wouldn't mind an agent who has a 6-7 year horizon and who isn't looking to milk immediately. 
excellent time yesterday chatting about cricket commentary and production with the legendary david hill. sadly, not much of that happens.  speaking to murali yesterday. he thinks you must always bat first in a day game and second in a night game.  don't know about elections and cabinet reshuffles but i do hope remains sports minister. at last someone talking right language 
delighted manoj tiwary got runs. has been scoring them for a while now. have always felt he will be better over 5 days than 20 overs.  oh, and by the way, the sky being blue was only about the prospect of getting two matches in today! seems to have sparked many responses!  absolutely serious. 
Send your Qs for Ganguly/Cook/Prior to If yr Q is chosen, u meet them at an event in Mumbai! Details   if you can find the 8 bowlers you can also become the alchemist of the year!  the talent shown today is at u19 level. it is not yet relevant at national level which is what i was talking about 
Sourav Ganguly, Alastair Cook & Matt Prior talk on #IndvEng, to host event orgnzd by Castrol & #JaguarCricket on Nov 2  india have never lost to pakistan in a world cup game; india haven't won a super 8 game since 2007. both stats meaningless once game starts  one way to preserve the under 19s is to keep advertisers & agents away as long as possible. they need to play cricket, not think of rewards 
really excited to meet the legendary david hill at the cii media event tomorrow. carrying his "ten commandments" with me!  morning patrick. big day for your boys too. ab at 3? jp at 4?  this shows that india has enormous talent, now to put structures in place to grow it, to maximise what is possible. 
big media conference tomorrow. the fake windsor will be put to test.  working on both games today. should be a fine cricket day. at the moment, sky has only colour: blue!  the journey for the under 19s, the chands, the harmeets, the aparajits, the smit patels, sandeep sharmas to reach next level will begin now 
i'm backing him to play an equally good innings from 100 yards away.....if he retains his interest that is!  if ind beat pak & sa beat oz both matches on the 2nd: ind v sa and pak vs oz become knockouts. if pak beat ind & oz beat sa,both qualify  out of the country for a couple of days and miss so much!! well done india u19. matched the seniors. proud of you. 
you never lose it altogether vaibhav! maybe it is still there, reach out to it!  very big day at world t20. oz v sa & ind v pak. results could produce either 2 knockouts on 2nd or 2 inconsequential games!  they will keep an eye on him but will do no more. he will have to rise through the ranks of fc cricket as is appropriate 
was a crowd puller no doubt, whether you loved him or not. but it is the way of the world,one generation goes & another appears  yes, by winning matches!  not in my hands 
but in a match the british media can neither score a run nor take a wicket or a catch.much like our media!don't get swayed.  tim southee almost wins new zealand a game one day, gets clattered for 32 in 2 the next. and we try and predict results!!  goodwill dene waalon ko kuch chance hai.....bas thoda.....yahan wahan.... 
i don't know . in any case, revenge is not a great objective in life!  sri lanka keeping nz alive here. if sl beat eng and nz beat wi, nz can still go through on nrr. if eng bt sl and wi bt nz, 3 way tie again  thanks and so many of you. yes i do want to do a home series, yes i do love test cricket, maybe some day.... 
i enjoyed doing it. it was a one-off. if asked again, might look at it!  just back from a very enjoyable evening for castrol with the legendary murali. he carries himself so simply.  there was only one guy missing. he would have happily stood at the gate welcoming people 
commercialisation allows best talents to come in; exellence allows them to deliver their best for the audience.  yes there was. our corporate programmes were being well received and we thought we would make them accessible to many more.  quick connect from bangkok airport on way to chiang mai. in case you missed the vvs piece here is the link  
must grab a coffee while you are here.  missed the umar gul blitzkreig as i was on my way to the ground. had driver translate radio commentary from sinhalese! must have been fun.  and then #thewinningway visits chiang mai for the people at bmc software on saturday. & i enjoy these corporate interactions. 
i'd go further & say sport has no future without it. commercialisation and good quality can, and often do, go together  and by the way, it is very easy to know what should have been done after we know what happened. captains don't have that benefit!  proud to be taking #thewinningway to accenture today. looking forward to a stimulating time. will keep eye on scores! 
dreamt.emergency call-up.unknown team.strapped pads,grabbed 1st bat i saw.rushed.took guard.looked up.tendulkar (cont)   everyone talks about t20 being a batting game. for all of watson and warner's brilliance, the bowlers set it up. cummins was outstanding.  what a pity missed out on the olympic gold quest evening yesterday. always put athletes first. need to support. 
many amit!  there could be some truth to the fact that the ball was wet but but have to accept australia were far superior. this was a knockout.  good to see the under 19s in the final. they are keeping a good tradition going. 
also, if players seek to induce mistakes from referees/umpires, they have no leg to stand on when it goes against them.  i went to work on a cricket match today. saw some cricket but no match.  the 1st 100 always special but pujara has scored so many, and big ones at that, it just seemed more predictable #pujara 
my point of view is that like players,officials & commentators, referees/umpires can have bad days too. it's the no of bad days that matters  a few more at the cinnamon grand!!  what a nice hundred from pujara and what a lovely moment for him. doubtlessly the first of many. #pujara 
not allowed to like football?? relax! we are all sports lovers you know!  because we have to be professional in what we do as the players have to be in their activity  tomorrow. just sending 
so if leagues appoint poor referees for big games, what does it tell you about the league! #justasking  oops correction!!! india vs australia!  would love to get some feedback from participants amit. always helps to refine our presentations 
so if leagues appoints poor referees for big games, what does it tell you about the league! #justasking  what a game this is! but must leave. have to be at ground in time for india v england. hope that is a good one too  but there was never any question of badri playing since he was the later selection. raina/rahane earlier picks. 
saw both . happy to go with what commentators say.  i think a finger spinner could get more out of this track than a wrist spinner. yuvi would be handy.  obviously pujara is at 3. just saw a shot with kohli not yet padded up and pujara ready. 
that is not true at all. maybe you are just searching for it. seen few players more loved. relax.  i wonder if ab is holding himself back too much. he is the best batsman in the side, certainly in this form.  the real india that seems uncomfortable to some: sikhs inviting muslims to offer prayers in a gurudwara because it was raining. good to read 
saw bits of united vs chelsea, heard commentators critical of the ref. think officials need to be a touch conservative on big game days  very interesting to see the speed of the pakistan spinners. bowling much quicker than normal, not allowing use of feet.  a beautiful and utterly charming and thought provoking piece from  
it wasn't difficult to predict the sixers as favourites. i thought they had a really bad day vs the titans but that apart, excellent  the grass and the carry on the pitch had an early ticket back? this is made for pakistan and they have the bowlers for it.  the first test i ever saw, as a little child, was against new zealand at hyderabad! 
the sixers had wicket taking bowlers bowling between 8 and 15. to me, all things considered, that was the key.  absolutely, they should. if they back bangladesh for a full test spot, they have to invite them.  though i have benefited from it, i agree! 
so the best team in the tournament won the champions league. the sydney sixers were deserving winners  latest article on indian express / cricinfo. need more from bangladesh among other things....   as the dust settles both sides will realise they need each other, kp will see the larger picture and realise why he first played this game 
ok, so we now have a hashtag #GetSkullToIndia. let's get it going.  but trying to run one yard lesser isn't sporting either!  i know this is just an instinct based on what i have read but i think england's best batsman over next 12-18 months will be kevin pietersen 
that and more will be my responsibility!  as it turns out this is what i wrote this morning:   such a good time with #thewinningway with bright, intelligent young leaders at hindustan lever yesterday. reassuring. 
i meant ensure that he is in the abc team to cover tests in india.  let's see how different the premadasa plays tomorrow. good night. see you for india v australia.  working on a vvs piece for the friday article. some excellent tributes around. meanwhile this is the video blog on him  
so news coming through that sourav ganguly will not be part of ipl6 for pune warriors....  eoin morgan should bat at no 4 shouldn't he? this was an astonishing innings and nobody will be certain of winning till he is there.  i've always felt that we give under 19 cricket way too much importance. read this from jamie alter for perspective.  
i know it is four months away but all you aussies let's start a campaign to get kerry to india in february  not in comm box, you would have heard me otherwise!!  it's the women who are much better with getting on with life. guys often wear a mask! 
guess anything can happen in t20 but sixers should be favourites. if haddin injured....might be a factor  am i? didn't have anything to do with it except spreading the message.  it is the way of all life.we did too.but the fact you feel this way means you have succeeded with him.i pine too! 
thanks gerard. hoping that and others will be here in march. must start a campaign for getting kerry over  it has been a good contest but not the greatest exhibition of cricket skills  if moving sehwag out of the opener's slot is too radical, rahane, with his record at that no, should do no 3.then kohli 5, pujara 6. 
a tribute to stylists. who are your favourites?   this is a brave move. samuels 2-0-25-0 and 1-0-22=0 i against australia  must confess i like raina's attitude as a cricketer but if he has to play, then you have to be thinking long term,including playing overseas 
overyhyped...maybe. restrictive....depends on your outlook. it needn't be if you choose it to be that way  will it come down to the loose bye kieswetter conceded off the last ball when england were fielding?  sehwag has often talked about being happy in the middle order. the arrival of rahane could be the moment to make that shift. 
thanks for your suggestion. delighted to disagree!  anyone remember ravi rampaul coming apart in the champions league last year? the last over, then the super over?  most obvious.would require viru to split completely from his past & for dhoni/fletcher to think it is best for him & india 
thanks shobhit. do spread the word!  er....no 4. they ran 2!  my video blog on vvs laxman cheers.  
i think sudarsan, if you retweet, you must keep the original language.  79 in last 7 from england  arre mulala sodayla gela aahes na? ka itkyat tyani sodla tula? 
that too! and the ian c who is a thorough professional in the commentary box  that is just incredible from andre russell. he's saved 4 and done it dramatically. game not over.  yes you will see my article on vvs on friday 
not sure about that but everybody is different. i wish some of them tried to understand india a bit better  england may not win this but are showing up the limitations of the west indies bowling.  i got the feeling that south africa always had a player in reserve whenever needed: kallis with the ball and duminy with the bat for eg. 
every good sports club has to be a well run company with winning and profit as twin objectives but maybe in that order.  england have quietly made 41 off the last 4  he kind of article you expect from a former captain.  
no am not a diehard arsenal fan. i keep an eye on the scores though.  i don't think anyone is having more fun these days than chris gayle is!!  what a wonderful tribute to vvs alex. i grew up in hyderabad and everyone flicked balls on off stump thro mid-wicket!! 
so that seals it right?  johnson charles? would have loved to watch you while he was batting!  and do wish him all the very best from all of us. coming of age time for him and, dare i say, for his parents!! 
happy for on his promotion, at last we had a sports minister who cared for sport. who gets the job now?  i wonder if england have played samuel badree before. skiddy leg spinner who likes taking the new ball.  the only weakness i see with this south african side is the absence of a quality spinner. also, will ab be the regular keeper now? 
and that article i just tweeted is a reason why i am such a fan of ian chappell the cricket lover.  notice people falling into the trap of judging selectors by their cricket stats! correlation not always established!  south africa win series with their biggest stars: kallis, ab & steyn playing supporting roles. indicative of what a good side they are 
one of the reasons i like oz cricket. ian chappell,once academy coach to ricky ponting, talks cricket to him. do read.   is it mandatory now for fielders to roll over after stopping a ball?  just shows that when test cricket is played between two good sides it is supreme. problem is not many good test sides! 
for arsenal fans who are a bit frustrated about money in the bank, not on the park.   i am assuming you know them well!  very impressed by england though. they kept going and with some better running, and their best batsman, might even have got there. 
hope you like it tushar. tell me about it  i thought bairstow is more scholes!!  south africa worthy winners; excellent all round side for those conditions. and held their nerve. delighted for them. 
only once for a week in 1997! hoping to get more opportunities.  gayle gone but how come they didn't run two off the earlier miss?  wow, says "If Sachin is called the god of cricket, then you, VVS are the angel we all strive to be." 
kya karen? sharafat se poocha tha!  sri lanka giving signs that their batting is a bit top heavy. need angelo mathews to produce a big one next time  ot surprised vvs was that kind of player and is that kind of man. will definitely read 
talking about doctors?i like to get facts straight before diagnosis!  new zealand surprisingly loose with the things they are normally good at in the super over.  ah, on twitter. nice. what's with the handle? tried to make sense!! 
must admit there is a touch of viru sahasrabuddhe there!  what would you give to have malinga in your side for the super over??  well done india u-19. cool head from harmeet but missed aparajith and zol. good? also nice to see some under 19s looking their age! 
hi aggers...so what's the latest...was looking forward to working with you guys again.  yes looking forward to doing india v oz tomorrow....in a stylish t-shirt!  finally hoping to catch "ferrari" today. and looking forward to shirin farhad.....when is the album coming? 
this 'famous' thing is a bit overdone in society, don't you think?  geelong rock!  think you must check the meaning of the word 'mercenary' 
ah...just decided one morning and never went back  no problem with that. but saying pls sms to vote for me is a bit jhalak-dikhla-ja-ish  and i hope all you parsis, of whom i have so many friends, had an excellent pateti 
maybe you can now start getting better than you have allowed yourself to be! all the best!  no. just saw him twirling his arms about and the moment he ran in, i thought this is the young siva i so loved watching.  meanwhile #thewinningway finds its way to more organisations which is deeply satisfying. good time at fidelity yesterday 
and enjoyed the drive too!  assure you my tweet and that of were completely independent!!!  touched that so many should ask. my desire to do test cricket in india must wait a while it seems. doing the t20s v nz & t20 world cup 
the other seriously awesome place i have been to in recent times in kangaroo island. our tasmanian guide took us to some breathtaking places  akila dananjaya reminds me in build, and excitement, of a very young laxman sivaramakrishnan.  in sri lanka at the time nakul! 
oops, didn't expect so many to reply so quickly. yes, milford sound, one of the great places on earth.  look back at the 1st stage of icc worldt20.  and two teams to watch out for.  and in reality, that should be the role of the central government which seems to abdicate responsibility on all matters 
spot on, only one so far!  is asking people to sms their votes for your book dignified? or is it modern reality?  eid mubarak to all friends: in india and around the world. 
since people asked about the background in the dp (which is what people notice in my pictures!), where do you think this is?  don't see the connection.  an interesting point of view from an indian muslim on muslims in india  
story of my life....people notice the background!  some good people in new selection committee. question is will they take hard decisions?  brearley right, kp seems insecure,in constant need of reassurance.small thing for leaders to provide in return for matchwinning performances 
trying to change your dp can lead to mysterious outcomes!  not surprised that shakib is frustrated with bangladesh performance.  vvs said he'd worked very hard last 3 months and was very keen to beat england and australia at home. but then realised this was the moment 
itte logan biryani ke baare me pooche.... shukriya. ab woh daur guzar gaya.....veg hone ke baad.  no but that's bad news for him!  said first thought came 4-5 days ago. voice within said you must go with the ideals with which you played the game #vvs 
one of the people i love reading on sport, paddy upton on losing. must read. then debate.   gali me ho ya bade stadium me, mera cricket har wakht tameez se khela jayega. ummeed hai tameez se dekha bhi jayega.  what a pleasure speaking to vvs just now. said he has no bitterness and is completely at peace with himself. so good to hear. 
enjoy reading comments on articles i write. just a thought after reading some on cricinfo....i fear we couldn't pick anyone!  simon taufel told me he thinks you pick the man first & get him to learn umpiring rather than someone who only knows rules and little else  requires a very special man to turn his back on a grandstand end & accept the moment has come. rose in my eyes if he could any more #vvs 
aap sab ko eid mubarak. padosiyon ke ghar ki biryani yaad aari.........  simon taufel was an excellent umpire and i think he will do a sterling job in trying to raise umpiring standards worldwide  was privileged to watch and know an artist over the years. what a batsman but also what a team player 
we're all different...we often want to people to hold views that we do and feel upset when they don't.  unfair to blame icc for super 8 groups.otherwise indian fans would be desperately seeking hotel rooms in kandy and english fans in colombo.  a man of great dignity says good bye with great dignity. that is how vvs laxman has always been #vvs 
don't deny...was just making a statement....when we take sides sometimes we don't think.....  is t20 like last 20 overs of an odi or a 50 over odi in which everything happens faster? beautifully explained.   seems a star from the land of my birth is saying good bye today. will wait to confirm but hope he goes out very proud of what he's achieved 
interesting too to see how many players succumbed to pressure. also tells you how much this game meant to them.  it could be a misconception but i sometimes get the feeling that the icc is keener to have d/l than the most appropriate system for t20  just landed in hyderabad to take #thewinningway to futures first. looking forward to meeting bright young people 
my man of the match was wiese. even though the titans lost that was "the" performance of the match.most other days o'keefe would have won it  2 very fine articles on why d/l doesn't work well in t20.  and then this   was fun following you on twitter. look forward to more from another part of the world 
after that start the sixers should have walked home with an over left. too many million dollar shots!  all the best kayoze. your dad made it big the hard way so it's there in your genes. sure you will too. cheers.  latest article  keep going on about bowling hoping someone somewhere listens!! 
excellent move by the selectors to include pujara and dhawan in the mumbai 'a' side to play england  if the selectors have to pick an indian team why is there so much concern about which zone or state they come from?  why, is that not right? 
what's the connection?  just saw batting averages & strike rates for top 5 bangladesh batsmen in t20 cricket. to win big games top 5 will need to do better.today?  just asking...always good to know what others think! 
good to hear from you. you well? notice from an earlier tweet that you are still playing long distance editor!!  that was funny though!  the telegraph asking if arsenal is now a 'feeder' club 
Cricket Australia's deal with espnstar is significantly larger than its deal with channel 9!   video blog post ind-eng game  cheers  with image rights van persie deal estimated 235k pounds /week. how many of those saying "traitor" would so no to that? 
"Cricket Australia has announced a $41 million rise in operating result due to India touring for last summer's Test & odi series".  a very happy birthday to you sir.....yours in cricket  not watching....which one was that? 
in south africa with help for the bowlers t20 is like a smaller form of a big game; a small portion of a large dish rather than a new dish.  was sent this nike cricket ad by someone. you like it?   sometimes players who are stars in one team struggle to play as just another player in another team. #rvp 
hope you have a fun game today. still up early with the construction?  which book?  ok got them about van persie. will be interesting to see the reception he gets at the emirates stadium 
hope you have a fun game today. still up early with the construction?  don't over-estimate!!  what seems good in theory doesn't always work well in practice 
it's not a bad place to have toasties and coffee neil!  i wonder though if staying relatively injury free has more to with the quality of your action. but true that body was not built to bowl fast  questions for all you football fans: la liga better than the epl? rvp a gunner this year? decisions normally so late? 
very interesting. hazard a guess on what valuations in other sports will be in another 5 years?  so if what sports scientists are saying is true you cannot get a fit consistent fast bowling sensation below 25  meaning discovering a lot more filth in areas you didn't know of? 
enjoyed watching starc,hazlewood,azhar mahmood,steve smith,umesh yadav at champions league but most of all aaron phangiso and neil mckenzie  sports scientists say fast bowlers under 25 can bowl 52-55 days/year. cricketers think the more you bowl the more you can bowl. who's right?  i have long felt this is the best england bowling side in a test match: anderson, broad, finn and swann 
ah, somebody thinks commentary isn't that simple. thanks for the link  look at question 2!!  thanks. you well?  look at it differently if your top 6 have to score 75% of the runs kp's 14.5% should be only marginally above par 
real cricket lovers and pioneers: cricket in serbia   no it isn't don't get conned. rahul is not on twitter  your call nitin to let people know but i must confess i don't enjoy doing these things. wasted too much of my time 
excellent on student types and what they need. which type of student are you?  fielding is pure hard work and pure practice!  read in the newspapers reshma...the indian express is normally right 
no gerard, had explained to jim. on sachin issue was one man's word against another & i was privy to neither.  yes with fielding it's just you and the ball. one on one. no bowler to get you out no batsman to hammer you. it's beautiful.  to be honest it was something we could have done without. i would actually have preferred not to reply. doesn't benefit anyone 
and the article this week  on the challenges the selectors should, hopefully, address.  "bowlers improve largely by bowling. batsmen improve by facing them". simple old-fashioned coaching truth from darren lehmann!  remember chatting with many times during ipl4 about his future. said he wanted to play for west aust again. now picked for oz! 
sharda ugra throws some light on the bcci-sky-bbc broadcast situation.   a beautiful story of cricket in another time. so wonderfully amateur and joyous  malcolm knox is a wonderful writer  delighted for you, young man! have a ball. hopefully will meet you in sri lanka and bag a drink off you!! 
happy to see that the new franchise will stay in hyderabad. i hope they give the city a team to be proud of.  first time in a nano today. must admit very comfortable even in the back seat.  is it ? read it in the indian express 
not just aaron phangiso, watch out for chris morris. was very impressed from first sighting two weeks ago. like his aggression.  ran into after dinner.happy to report that he is back to being a complete prankster!  never before have i seen those that govern have as little respect among those that they govern. 
and what was with the fielding yesterday. in a 140 game, 10-15 runs in the field is a very significant number. can create a swing of 25  not if you have travelled that far. you have to be a real fan to accept that!  playing for india must mean you have to qualify from a tough school. if handed on a platter loses its glory. 
for those who think cricket is really an indivdual game,success of teams like nsw blues,t&t &highveld lions shows great value of team spirit  just back from meeting such a pleasant person to talk to.  deeply saddened by stories of assamese leaving bengaluru out of fear. we are sitting on a huge problem here. 
lots of thinking to do for the ipl as the last team crashes out. conditions matter but there were many internationals there.  tiny clip of usain bolt bowling to chris gayle. very decent action.   here's an interesting read forwarded to me.  in fact the entire site is a pretty good read. 
peculiar one because j'dene captain, must play. warner open,sehwag at 3 option. following tms/sky situation?  if you don't pre-seed, fans will not know till very late which matches their team is playing. then, tough to get tickets/hotels etc.  but we are still independent, democratic and give our people a chance. much to feel thankful for on independence day. 
a lovely article from a good leader and a fine man, daren ganga.   many asking about super8s.pre-decided based on icc rankings. helps organisation and fans select their matches in advance. done for fans.  our real stars, those that keep us going, are largely invisible. those that we see, in positions of power, must know they let us down. 
so what did u expect gambhir to say when asked?"i'm not good anymore" or "i should be dropped".you can disagree but that's what he will say!  hope so too rajesh...tell me if you like it. and even if you don't.  65, young, soaring sometimes, muddling its way through at others, pride and disillusionment as neighbours but still our india. 
not saying he is right, saying that he has the right to his point of view. different things you know.  so nice from sandeep dwivedi: a fine writer and an excellent editor.   why, what happened? 
it's a thin line between arrogance and confidence. better than having less confidence though.  yes as of now i am down to do all the india super 8s games.  as we get set for our independence day time to wish our friends in pakistan happy independence day today. 
might have been even better if india had picked spinners and hoped to run through england in the tour game.  i did, nice.  must send you a photograph of when we went to jacob's creek! 
see no harm in gambhir mentioning numbers. he is entitled his point of view as we are ours. don't we all defend ourselves?  good atmosphere at the premadasa today. good match, good crowds, decent surface....excellent  wah, pachaas ramiz bhai! bahut bahut mubarak.wish you great times and fine taste in music! 
but centuries aren't the greatest indicators. no of runs / batting avg better. 101 much greater than 98?  need to be careful about sitting in judgement when we know the result. person taking the decision doesn't at the time  outstanding from my old friend jarrod kimber. analytical, not just wicked as he sometimes can be!!  
chhote ho na, hota hai!  captains are allowed to back their instinct. and dhoni has been correct more often that he has been wrong.  interesting. aug 14 bradman's last test innings, tendulkar's first century. 
last 20 months 52 at home (8 innings), 15 overseas  will need to see how the rest of the pitches on the square play. but given that ashwin, bhajji & chawla all bat, not difficult to play all  had said anything above 5 medals would mark a big change in perceptions. has happened for all us. now for the administration to build on it 
maybe since had jayawardene, sehwag, chand & pietersen in top order...needed finisher...delighted to see ponting scoring runs  no doubt at all that india will play two spinners from here on. but the pitch wasn't turning too much, was just bad batting.  don't know how other newspapers covered it but shivani naik at the indian express was in top form too. 
grieving over an utterly beautiful silsila  delighted to get through the day today. wouldn't have missed it for anything. hope didn't sound unwell.  and espn star sports made it enjoyable live too. in all a fine viewing experience. 
congrats everyone....and very well deserved.  the producer was all right!! getting more assertive which is excellent to see.  summarisers like col rathore, michael ferreira, jagbir singh, geet sethi etc were top of their game. helped bring olympics into focus 
cool. thought he looked sharper playing for rcb. and was told that he was touching 140. will go by your word. cheers  looks like the bug is spreading...sleeping in. hoping to be better before game starts.  i thought india's coverage of the olympics was top class. & team take a bow. 
only concern medium pacers may not be the future. was looking at someone quicker. but if you & me were selectors.........  if semi-finals no result, winner decided by no of matches won in super 8s and group stage. so winning today could be important  on air on cnn-ibn with karan thapar in 10 mins about india and the olympics 
tactic of not playing spinner similar to what south africa did some years ago. flat wicket for warm up, trampoline at durban  only hope this rain has not set in. some fine matches coming up. good night.  dear sport is the last thing on the minds of many of those billion. they have more fundamental needs. 
incredible. was zeroing in on pretty much this side. was thinking of a mandeep maybe & shami/harshal patel for vinay.  enjoyed being in the comm box today with ian chappell, ian bishop and damien fleming. different characters, great fun  so at the end of it all let us put our hands together, wherever we are, to london for an outstanding games. 
slightly different objective but get your point. what would your 11 have been for the a team game v england?  west indies thrilling side to watch but i suspect the side that bowls better might have the better chance  future of indian sport,as harsh goenka said,lies in public-private partnerships.this show in the olympics will give that a boost 
if you have to pick 15, you and i can do it! selections are supposed to send out a signal. they are paid to take decisions!!  pity about the rain but nice to see the crowds come back. was an excellent match till then....  if the sports ministry can make the private sector welcome, and not treat it as pockets to pick as they used to, they will find much support 
so which are the two openers the selectors believe are next in line? vijay? rahane? dhawan? mukund?  ah, you're on twitter!!  the future of indian sport,as harsh goenka said, lies in public-private partnerships. this show in the olympics will give that a boost 
i wonder why selectors can't just pick 12 players for an india 'a' game. that way they will be making a decision.  off to do west indies vs australia. should be a top game. weather fine.  hi if you and many others really want to contribute to olympic goldquest do send them a message on 
i wonder how the gods would respond if we could ask them if they approve of the way we celebrate them.  latest video blog day after afghanistan game   i really hope we don't begin on the 1.2 billion people theme. it is the most flawed argument of all 
since vijayadashmi symbolises the triumph of good over evil, can we see some good in public life today? anybody there?  unfortunately groups pre-decided. ind, pak,sa, oz in 1 group; wi, sl, eng, nz in the other. unless a qualifier beats 1 of them  a silver medal in the olympics is a phenomenal achievement. and it was a phenomenal performance by sushil to achieve it. #sushilkumar 
a very happy vijayadashmi to you. may your festival be quiet and dignified.  unfortunately groups pre-decided. ind, pak,sa, oz in 1 group; wi, sl, eng, nz in the other. unless a qualifier beats 1 of them  excellent point from the jugaad concept conflicts directly with what is needed for sporting success. 
cool. that's what they called me at home...hence the surprise!  now you know why i don't reply...maybe made a mistake being polite to you.  the moment india began asking "how many" rather than "will we" it was evident there was a change in mindset 
absolutely. and mandatory. by the way, who's that "sir" you were referring to?  can understand what oz are doing here...protecting their interest...nothing wrong with that but everyone the same!!  haha. done with the cricket? 
what was that!!!  sorry about that...don't always have time....even this morning, just sitting down to do toi article!  apparently yohan blake can bat a bit but keeps getting run out!!! 
mulich nahi. changli tournament aahe. kharach  that's changing too.players moving states...signing up for other big bash teams..world needs to get over this ipl paranoia  this is a measure of how we are growing. we now have a double olympic medalist #sushilindia 
sydney sixers once again showed the power of a top bowling side. repeat: that is the way t20 is going.  absolutely they are not the only ones!  easy decision! gow2 can wait! 
early morning start. on way home with the chennai boys. guess excitement and apprehension at the season ahead for some of them.  but why would those teams be meaningless darren?  sushil's final at 1833. india, stop what you are doing and watch. 
the mumbai indians punched below their weight (to twist an expression!). will hurt not to have won a single game.  tough in 140 characters!  was a bit worried because he looked tired. but in the last minute....that was something else...#sushilindia 
the news from south africa for all you aussie fans is that brad haddin is catching as well as he ever has.  is it already a year that i choked on a news channel coming to terms with tiger pataudi's death? just a great man.  saw some other bouts, looked tame by comparison. this guy is aggressive. now gold? 
everytime i see steve smith play, i come away more impressed. today's run a ball 41 was a very good example of how to play the situation  aussie papers saying cricket australia encouraging players to play champs league but not ipl. shareholders in champs league! not a surprise  wow! that was some bout. sushil kumar is seriously special. 
brad haddin said they have some "smart" cricketers. that is what you need...players who just know what to do in different situations  neer dosa and chutney frieda kahlo style? can understand saroja devi style........  is it only me or does sushil look and sound like sehwag? same accent, similar attitude! najafgarh effect? 
that's cheating vincent! i said "beaten and bowled" which means something completely different as you well know.  of course it was cardiff....even bumble seemed to nod along!  sushil not yet assured of a medal. if wins next bout either silver or gold, if loses has to grapple with the guy who comes thro repechage 
bowlers still want to do well, batsmen still want to score runs and cricket lovers can still love cricket!!  did but should have guessed!  all those who complained about india's bad luck should now celebrate good luck. in crucial 2nd period sushil drew red ball. 
that is how sports teams are managed all over the world!!  no afghanistan looked better against india because india didn't have bounce.  sushil beats the olympic champion. looking good. 
this should be a tricky chase for mumbai indians. ball not coming on. but need to be careful not to be over-cautious  the square at the premadasa is huge though i suspect there are two pitches selected  small article on the yuvraj issue and team selection in toi  if you can't open the link go to epaper page 25 
my last game at the champions league starts in a 15 minutes. home tomorrow night....will look forward to india vs england.  i greatly suspect that when teams were picked they assumed these would be traditional sri lankan pitches.  so how many of you think the rioters in mumbai knew anything about assam? my guess: none. 
i won't be surprised if some ipl franchises let expensive players go to cut costs; maybe even buy them back at a lesser price  on tracks like the one in pallekele and the premadasa, teams that like to bowl seam up and bat against it are getting a lifeline.  so was kevin pietersen given an ultimatum and is that why he has made a complete turnaround?  
october 31 is the last date for ipl franchises to renew contracts with their players. wonder which players will be released by their teams?  far too many people rushing to conclusions that didn't even cross my mind on the retweeting issue. gap between assumption and reality.  so was kevin pietersen given an ultimatum and is that why he has made a complete turnaround?  
are you doing the duleep trophy?  that is a slightly naughty assumption. can't one raise issues without conspiracies?  well done yogeshwar dutt--another great story as tells us. takes us to that 5 medal figure. well done mittal champions trust 
so csk's umbrella man does it again. lose 2 wickets early send out badrinath to calm things down.  more and more people retweeting nice things said about them. is that the new normal in a pr driven world?  what do you think of olympic reportage?  
just took an excellent catch but agree with you. from his point of view, the more he plays the better for him.  how much did the small things hurt afghanistan today? catches, fieding, no-balls.....  hyderabadi cooks are now being sent to other cities during ramzan to make haleem! 
wasn't aware of this question from . thanks for all the responses.  for teams from our part of the world bounce is always an issue. that is why i hadn't expected afghanistan to trouble england  thoughts at the end of the ind-sri lanka series  sorry about audio quality #stepoutwithharsha 
woorkeri, would be very keen to see your team for the 1st test against england. put on your selector's hat!  because you don't need to wait for the 2nd bail. if 1 dislodged fine  by the way, a link to yesterday's article  
very balanced piece from just reinforces my view that indian cricket needs to use him more   this is the link from for cricket lovers in the us.   by the way, did i miss some brilliant spells from ishant sharma in the last month that makes him ready to take the new ball for india? 
would be amiss to not congratulate saina nehwal. it might seem blasphemy to my generation but as great as prakash padukone?  yes i have been told that the world t20 will be on espn3. so all you cricket lovers in the us...enjoy!  looking at the bowlers picked for the world t20 and especially the test match i greatly fear the cupboard is far barer than i thought. 
excellent move by csk to ask raina to lead & saha to keep. saha needed to be seen to be keeping and allows dhoni to relax and maybe bowl!  how are 4,5,6,7 going? in ipl tend to get a spike in 4,5,6 and a trough in 7  overjoyed for but i would have liked it better if he had played a few matches by now. 
was off twitter and news so completely unaware of the death of yash chopra. saw so many many of his films and enjoyed them. #ripyashchopra  they definitely won't understand each other's sledges!  and just back from unveiling the icc world t20 trophy at a pepsi promo event. was asked a lot of questions! 
at last a hotel room (elangeni) that allows you to open windows! excellent sea breeze comes through. durban looking good.  doing england v afghanistan today. suspect the afghans will struggle against extra bounce. but will be great if they can make a statement.  fantastic time in chennai will old old friends for my dearest friend 50th birthday. 
kingsmead looking good. hopefully will stay that way. no prospects of qualification but hopefully good cricket  that will be fun....which of you is the better off-spinner?  ravi bopara pulls out again for personal reasons just when his international career seemed back on track. hope all is well with him. 
wow, thanks for the responses. daren will wish he wasn't sitting next to me now!  no.hadn't but will definitely do so. thanks.and my friend copied here will see it many times!   ok let me admit it. i have met marykom twice and each time i have stood at a distance and gaped. 
lots of people recommending this song by bhupen hazarika. must look it up once i get to durban  no they don't vignesh  it's been a very long time since i have seen a nation so stirred by a simple woman extolling simple virtues #marykom 
how did i miss that?  latest column on indian express / cricinfo   absolutely. shows you simple things like determination & ambition can stir indians so used to callousness in public life 
that's a good one....know the tune  poornapane!  wow? is that what we are proud of now? 
travelling with daren ganga, trying to explain "ganga" songs to him. "tu ganga ki mauj..." and "ganga, aaye kahan se..." any more?  i hope so!  bravo #marykom nobody but you could have embraced the hurdles in your path and brought india a medal. proud of you. huge fan. 
thanks saurav. re: tests, watch this space!  i know but true of almost all centres now i fear  sorry got a second copy. my mistake, probably asked about it too early. 
and so to durban this morning. semi-finals decided but will hopefully get excellent cricket: like the mi/csk game  if you are interested in the media business here's something to read   bit perplexed with india playing 4 bowlers. ok if those 4 are seriously world class but they are not. 
delighted for dinesh karthik today. he is a fine cricketer and hopefully has some solid years ahead of him  and to you....but rahul is a friend!  am i the only one who finds hero's "chidiya" ad offensive & reinforcing ugly stereotypes? letdown from a co that has produced fine advtg 
we were told a storm would hit the wanderers at 1640. thankfully, one of the days when the forecast was wrong.  do email me. presume you have the id  if they can't keep pace with latest trends, if they don't have a large enough player base, if they are complacent.... 
the great value of fielding shown up again today. catches by raina & saha made such a difference.  i fear we might be on the way there too  ah, maybe that is where the problem was. last game coming up you think? 
some excellent cricket today but played in the shadow of the news about we must all support and cheer him up.  you well patrick. can this be the one for south africa i wonder?  those kind of names..... i don't mind dropping!! 
said a little prayer for you from your beloved south africa. if wishes from your well-wishers could work, you'll smash the C.  if you are born after 1987 go and watch fire in babylon to know what it must have been to see that team in its prime  yes i have never had occasion to doubt my hypothesis that women are the stronger of the species. 
oh dear, johannesburg overcast. hope the clouds stay high. carrying a jumper! cheers  there was something about that group of players. never has a team that decimated the opposition been so liked.  admire people who can write such wonderful well-researched books. i get worked up over an 800 word piece! 
indeed it is. and he has taken to twitter like a fish to water! though his favourite fish is on the plate!  obviously backing levi but faf is a fine player at the top of the order too  and that's as it should be. my larger issue is with generating trust and handling mavericks who have much to contribute 
absolutely. we must each be allowed our taste. but preparing the calendar will be tough  nobody at hambantota to watch south africa v zimbabwe. reflection of a larger trend. games need a context relevant to local population  delighted to find you here. your book on jesse owens and joe louis one of the best i have read. cheers 
a few. but not too many.  only went to school for two years in marredpally (st johns). didn't live there. lived on the campus and then in snehapuri.  handling mavericks (kp) is an essential part of team management. sometimes an arm around the shoulder works better than a slap on the wrist 
no mohan. your profession can be your passion. some of us are lucky in that regard. love this game deeply  maybe you should record it and put it up so we can listen!  if indeed kp didnt speak to "a single media person" about meetings with the ecb & it still became public someone in the ecb has been naughty 
no mohan, very much part of the "aam". and very happy to be so!  more people in good magazines writing delightful prose. this from manu joseph.   when 5 yr old children are saying 'come home mummy' marykom still summons the resolve to fight. rose hugely in my wife's eyes for that! 
it's called being polite, respectful.....but you won't understand anyway!! cheers.  shukriya bismillah. loved the way they played  she was the mc for the evening. and good at it too 
sir, not your league....merely talking about the aam spectator! and his choices.  have they been at the centre of much economic turmoil too?  the applause that greeted marykom's win leads me to believe that she is now genuinely a national hero. what joy if she can get to the final 
if lions beat yorks in game 1 today, as they seem likely to,that seals the group.washout keeps mi alive,yorkshire win keeps everyone alive  if you are feeling despondent here is something from the education and social sector to lift your spirits   as a result, missed marykom's bout but heard the result almost immediately. announced to everyone with a childlike glee 
frankly don't understand 'one vs the other'. don't like t20 don't watch it. don't like tests don't follow them. like both? enjoy both!  doesn't a bandh hurt the very people it pretends to support?  and yes, finally got to meet and talk to the person i had always wanted to. madhuri dixit. 
it is possible to like both test cricket and t20. they are not mutually exclusive. must learn to appreciate different skills.  congrats drew and richly deserved. trust all well  just back from #thegreatestindian shoot. quite a feeling being with shabana azmi & mandira bedi. good fun 
you think my friend has a point? RT "If playing Twenty20 is so easy how come so many test cricketers are so bad at it?"  mohammad nabi's six off zaheer was the shot of the day, just ahead of yuvraj's awesome shot off shapoor zadran  it is specific to this evening....there are many legends i would travel far and wide to meet..... 
i would love to...some day! enjoyed meeting you  i hope i am wrong but i get the feeling this is a 12 man squad.  have met legends : lata mangeshkar (once) and 2-3 times. so someone else....... 
better now...you know what it is like....but we simple folk, don't travel with managers etc!!  good workout for india today. could have been a bit tricky but better than an easy game. very impressed with afghanistan's fight  gitanjali? what's that? 
thanks for all those amazing responses! pasta not quite what i hoped but good enough!! now for rain to stay away in jo'burg tomorrow!  maybe a slip of the tongue amazing how many people picked it up!  would be an interesting exercise to look at qualities in other professions that cannot be coached. 
guess what! sidhu is vegetarian too! we have often gone out looking for a good veggie meal!  delighted bumble brought up the issue of umpires carrying cards to prevent abuse on the field. an idea whose time has long come.imperative.  a little indulgence if you don't mind. ref: earlier tweet who do you think is this person i'm terribly excited to meet today? 
thairsatham! ikkada ela dorukutundi?  bachho!  wonderful piece by to understand the influence and passion of the 1st coach in the development of a champion  
can't believe just sent me a youtube link on how to make avial!! in a hotel room in johannesburg!! thanks. maybe at home!  when my father wanted to chat with me, he put two chairs in our garden in hyderabad. i find him in me every day.  my school did not have a rival!! 
don't know any other!  i have had an association with them for almost fifteen years now.  went back to bed....more to life than tweeting! 
would give anything to have a nice avial just now.....but room service have been kind and have promised a nice pasta full of veggies!!  john abraham is castrol's brand ambassador and he is going to tweet from all you bikers/fans, have fun following him.  still believe was the best writing i did. maybe i should do a limited release without updating...as a snapshot of how it was 
at least you can sing to yourself and create joy!! hope you are well. cheers  and an earlier one. looking ahead to the world t20   interesting. thanks. 
yes absolutely. hard core vegetarian!  the first video blog from sri lanka  more to follow during the tournament  at recording of #thegreatestindian today. many stars apparently, including one i have been a huge fan of but never met!! 
flip side of touring. hungry and alone in a hotel room. room service looking depressing.  very interesting points of view on the evolution of t20 cricket from 3 fine cricketers.   what is it about jamaica that produces so many sprint champions? only trying to emulate heroes or deeper know-how? 
no it cannot....wonder why it slipped out. happens sometimes in live tv where you cannot recall words.  following scores of the eng v pak game. pitch at p sara stadium might well be very different from that at the premadasa.  set alarm to watch the 100m final. what a race! athletics enthusiasts, where does usain bolt stand in the all time list of sprint champions? 
don't worry, that won't happen....have a life beyond this too! relax. try and understand, fine if you disagree  thanks for the links to the toi epaper. here is the piece on the modern kabuliwallahs   one more win for the most eagerly awaited medal of the games for me. can imagine how good she must be in her normal weight category 
and her steaming cup of coffee was perhaps the best!  have done a piece in times of india today on afghanistan. possible for someone to send an epaper link?can't seem to access from here. thanks  what a bout.marykom moving up from 46 to 51 kg,her opponent,taller,heavier coming down from 54, everything stacked against her...& she wins! 
understand where you are headed. but biggest innovations in bowling come on flat decks because you need to  occasionally differing points of view cannot come in the way of acknowledging a point of view. take care.  so marykom should be on soon. fighting in a higher weight class against a much bigger opponent. hopefully should do well 
you don't? what a pity! that's been the hallmark of t20 cricket in recent times. cheers.  no, not in studio but in commentary for both england games. cheers.  good read from andrew leipus  
have been enjoying watching bowlers in t20 cricket. latest article.  what do you think?  notice hockey india league well on track.hope they pick franchise owners with long term vision.strength of league is strength of franchises  that is the problem with going with numbers alone! 
let me know if you are going to be our part of the world again. must catch up.  really nice and very well researched.why limited overs cricket is different.  strong views but better than no views!  absolutely. he has to 1 among 5. his batting allows india to play 5 and play that role 
think loves the game too much to be away from it for long. 6ers without watson?haddin might have to play that role  you were fine yesterday. another day or two and the banter will be more fun. see you around.  it is a very very small group to top. 
ah, good to know, i thought that was everyday with some!!  wish all of you a very happy and auspicious ganesh chaturthi.  now rohit sharma has to be told that he must do one season of uninterrupted first class cricket. must make 6-7 100s to prove his ability 
hi emma, how have you been? still photographing cricket from everywhere?  bowlers used to take 6 for 8 in inter-school first round matches  and i hope more people realise that kevin pietersen is by some distance england's best batsman. 
jaisimha always had an aura about him. but he was so fair & encouraging. marredpally cricket club was a great club full of generous people  sri lanka's running today has been more than just a touch frenetic. and zimbabwe don't field as well as they used to.  good to see some stated points of view being proved. irfan pathan has to play for india in odis. 
ref this article  i actually played 'a' div games against jaisimha's mcc. it was always a joy, we looked forward to it  once again sri lanka's best t20 opener drops down to accomodate someone else. surely jayawardene should open  suddenly thinking of an army subedar who won silver. we must celebrate vijay kumar's medal as spiritedly. 
delighted that will tour india with england. adds a lot more to the series. cricket needs its best to play often  easy one that. big fan of kevin pietersen the cricketer. suspect he will feel the same  well done you are showing that with the right support indian athletes can do wonderful things. 
if lions beat yorkshire, both csk and mi go out. i hope though that weather doesn't have a bigger part to play  did. trying to recollect when it was shot  quietly, olympic gold quest, the most dedicated sports people, have helped 3 olympic medallists and will hope devendro makes it four. 
pity about the rain. mumbai indians were well placed. but highveld lions still favourites to go through with a game against yorkshire  these afghan cricketers are travellers too....kabuliwalas  and now that saina is an olympic medallist let us raise a huge cheer for the humble and unassuming gopichand. 
no it doesn't. win 2 in 2 gives them 8. if lions win 1 still home. so nothing changes after today  thinking of some of the names in the afghanistan side as i wrote a piece for tomorrow's toi.  what a day this is turning out to be. what a performance from devendro singh to make the quarter final. 
that is gs ramchand!  watched again. balraj sahni is in the frame but the person "singing" is someone else (wm khan). lyrics prem dhawan; music salil chowdhary  the emotions of a parent...saina's father talking of her "deewnapan" while training & her single-mindedness. how much have the parents done! 
look forward to it. hopefully we can make it meaningful  just read somewhere that "ae mere pyaare watan" is picturised on someone called wm khan. anybody know for certain?  it is sinking in now....oh saina, you make us so proud..you show what is possible.. 
need to win both remaining games and hope lions lose to yorkshire.  as i sit thinking of tomorrow's game my mind wanders towards this amazing combination of balraj sahni & manna (cont)   what a great reward for the years and years of toil that saina has put in while no one was watching. poignant but a win nonetheless. 
spotlight on starc and cummins. hazlewood looking very impressive meanwhile.....  accept that list of top wicket takers could also be due to games played  you want to win in a full game but saina will take that 
very impressive from the sydney sixers. showing great importance of playing five proper bowlers. were able to pull it back as a result  picked out of cricinfo article on top wicket takers. ajmal, botha, hafeez, swann, mccullum, afridi.  reading stories of troubles in the deccan chronicle.so many memories....1st article, 1st mention (4-41 in a lower div game).... 
wow, someone's got good taste. humming as i head off to shower before leaving for the ground in capetown.  they do. on spongy pitches where the ball doesn't come on. don't search for meanings that aren't there!  no journalist should ever go to a press conference without a recorder and should never ever quote without listening to the recording. 
and who knows, might just be a blessing in disguise!  desperate to get angry? said "spinners" of doubtful pedigree. meant those part-timers who slip in an over or 2. relax.  one day i will meet a young journalist who, while quoting me, will use my language not his/hers. murdered in a nashik paper again. 
that is why the champions league is a good event. it gives them a stage.  since the 2010 world t20 6 of the top 7 bowlers have been spinners. not too many predicted that back in 2007.  haven't got this month's issue yet. shouldn't i have got it by now? 
compared to some evenings where you order room service in capetown!  pitches at the premadasa are hard & have decent carry (if you hit the deck!).those who played in the murali era say it was unthinkable then.  spare a thought for joydeep karmakar. how many us are 4th best in the world at what we do. well done joydeep, proud of you. 
did use the word "good" though! cheers.  on the understanding that all pitches on a square will play almost similarly the premadasa could see lots of runs.  hope we celebrate vijay kumar's medal so it inspires others..that is how a tradition is built up--like with gagan narang and col rathore 
most good companies do serious checks before signing endorsees. but the armstrong affair tells you that you can never do enough.  i suspect dhoni is more comfortable playing 7 batsmen. that requires each of the 4 bowlers to have a good day. may not be that easy!  "we are sunny leone fans" class xi student from np model school tilak marg : oops young man, already started wrong in life! 
so nike have had to terminate contract with lance armstrong. that was one contract they would have been most certain of.  absolutely enjoyed watching saeed ajmal bowl and chatting with him later in the evening. is he at his peak or will he get better?  so much seems to have happened. had to miss federer vs del potro. looks like it really captured the essence of the olympics. 
so many similarities between english football and indian cricket!  before the game we knew india's bowling was weak, pakistan's batting was unpredictable, both had slow movers in the field!  missed saina's match too. she's a champion. ultimate respect when an event is called china vs saina! 
good it worked out. yes he is a very good man and, as it turns out, a very good cricketer!!  ok then see you tomorrow from colombo. afternoon start on star cricket (think it is 1345 or 1400). should be a fun tournament.  also, latest article on indian express / cricinfo.  should india lose its knowledge in spin? your thoughts? 
bad luck today, not in the tournament. thought that was clear!  on twitter today i am being directed to worlds beyond cricket. allowing me to confirm that cricket is only a small world.  we are now building a bit of a tradition with shooting. that is what know-how does to you. you have people to learn from & people to emulate 
no it didn't...someone here would have noticed otherwise. relax.  excellent and touching. stoked so many memories....guess that's what a good writer does.  missed all the action today. out beyond gurgaon, in sohna, with #thewinningway for max india. got the great news as soon as i landed! 
bad luck to kkr. but they will be the first to admit they could have done better.  very simple and meaningful piece from  sure many of us have such stories to tell  saina nehwal and jai bhagwan on around now 
been reading here and there. is there one article that tells all?  was just directed to you on twitter. it seems they make good recommendations these days! cheers.  born in kurnool 
the rain in durban meant i switched channels and saw an excellent 2nd half of england vs poland. that half surely was poland's  one reason why santosh desai is one of the finest columnists of our time   oh by the way away from the olympics another hyderabadi finding his way around. poised to make his test debut for new zealand 
watching kkr today convinced me all over again that the indian system is still a generation behind with producing uniformly good fielders.  starting to get excited by the world t20. privileged to do something that keeps you excited after all these years.  interesting that england left out swann. think selection of finn was right but thought he might have come in for bresnan. 
why did you think so? anything you noticed?  and isn't that lovely...someone very involved in what he/she does.  guess i was wrong about vijay kumar qualifying. needs another 30 shots. avalanche of tweets pointing that out. thanks. 
guess so but kalam and lahu.......  and neither is the place to be on a sunday morning!  oh no, ronjan sondhi fails to qualify. he must be gutted. you've got to believe he gave it his best shot....bad luck. 
oh dear, just saw 'that' part of salman khurshid's speech. had always thought he was measured & dignified. sad.  not kind iain, just appreciative of quality. and have felt some of what you said! trust all going well with you.  thanks champ. guess i should stick to one game!! 
what timing! as it turns out was just listening to the segment on holi and diwali and madhushala!  excellent from iain o'brien.  that is why good leaders put aside time to understand people, make them comfortable  so vijay kumar qualifies in the 25 m rapid fire pistol at no 5 just one shot off the leader. great if he can convert that to a medal 
unusual morning for me. 2 youtube windows open.@SrBachchan & manna de singing madhushala! alas, soon back to cricket. article for tomorrow!  now that the zonal rotation system for bcci office-bearers has gone it is time to do away with zonal representation for selectors.  thank you. was following it here.  need to go out,hopefully good news when i return!!! 
that waqar interview: great example of a person knowing his subject inside out and an interviewer probing intelligently.  inevitable should surprise no one.  is 23 the total no of shooters in the men's double trap or is there another set of qualifiers. anyone knows? 
an interview i wished would never end.  nagraj gollapudi talking to waqar younis. have saved to read many times over  have you had to wrestle with one recently too!!  after 50 shots sodhi is 4th in his group but with joint highest score. another 100 shots left in qualifying so long way to go. 
no manoj i think he was right yesterday. it was a reason, not an excuse.  it means you are now more successful than you thought you would be!  this looks interesting.... my old friend saad bin jung is doing something very interesting  
i absolutely enjoyed the two top catches today. aaron phangiso and suresh raina. just brilliant.  surely the time has come to say goodbye to wine bottles with corks!  thanks neeraj. will tell my friend who sent it to me 
there wasn't a lot today, we were checking. but can't hide behind that.  badminton in hyderabad has infrastructure and a coach. look at the results.  far too often trps were quoted as the need to be undignified in television; hopefully advertisers will support simple, classy programmes too 
with australia producing such high quality quicks, and with few spinners, wonder if another four fast bowler era is round the corner?  from the professor, i will take it as law! hope you are well deano.....  really hope the lid is blown off the tam ratings and we can live secure in the fact that not every programme has to be loud, rude and crass. 
the sydney sixers were awesome. once again a bowling driven side creating waves. that's what we saw in the world t20 too.  come on sanjay.....tell us something we don't know!!!  saina's match last night seemed too simple; maybe a tougher game would have helped before the big ones. 
the highveld lions were excellent today. everytime the situation needed someone to take control, someone did. no fear.  was concerned by the low scores in the warm up games until i discovered they're not being played on the grounds where actual matches will be  you really love cycling...... 
csk only had one indian seamer in their squad. and with the captain not confident of his ability, it limits his choices greatly.  reminder that india v pak t20 warm up game live on espn star sports. on air (as i know) ganguly, manjrekar, bhogle, raja, akram  both doubles matches look very tough. llodra tsonga in men's and ivanovic and zimonjic in mixed. 
so in two days aaron phangiso has outbowled harbhajan and ojha, then jadeja and ashwin. something serious there you think?  so, on engineers day how many people are practising engineers and how many only engineering graduates?  but isn't the minister the ceo? 
relax. love game too much to have biases. have been accused both ways, neither is true!  excellent links from this morning..how much do these guys read?thought was the only one giving others a complex!  if we can repose faith in politicians for 5 years we must do so with coaches. it is an uphill climb back for indian hockey. 
elitist ? me? that's new...maybe i should be aware of that perception....  oh dear that's bad news for me...i postponed to next month!  when a team is in turmoil for many years it takes time to become consistent--to lose bad habits picked up. indian hockey will take time 
i'm not against negative reporting. i'm against only negative reporting. and rude responses!! cheers. on that note, off to the ground.  agree with fewer teams make for stronger competition. trick lies in making no of teams optimal to ensure large enough base  need to know, easier than sitting at home and becoming cynical....these are young people from small towns 
inundated by tweets on the "negativity" theme. blessed to be in a profession where i see positive, uplifting things so often.  but it is a story that needed to be told. always a second innings in life  loved steve waugh's line: not about archery coming to lords but the olympics taking lords to the rest of the world 
hi that's the other thing i've noticed. people replying on social media are getting a little more rude.  hope more people realise that drink is not the solution to despair; that alcohol is seriously over-rated  so that is it for archery then. flatter to deceive again. did the occasion get to them i wonder? 
everytime i scan the indian papers i see negative stories. is that what we are becoming as a nation? or is there a bias towards negativity?  wine, mahesh! gets better though ayaz will probably understand a single malt better!!  agree absolutely. commentary has been too patriotic at times and too much disdain for oriental names 
not surprised by the order of australia award to sachin. have seen how he is regarded there and he admits to being moved by it.  from  jaysuriya, kamran akmal and gayle have among highest dotball % in t20. they make up in style!  well played kashyap. tremendous final game. and good to see the dignified way he and gopichand reacted after the win. 
very bright day in capetown. hoping to see good, competitive cricket.  you know shyam, sometimes we want others to state our point of view. there is always a point of view, maybe it's not yours. cheers.  strange from kashyap in the second game...looked at times like he was sparring. hopefully there is a plan we don't know! 
very cold and windy in capetown. hoping for better weather tomorrow. doing 2 games: sixers v yorkshire & csk v lions  looking ahead to the world t20   in another era we might have seen an apology from the cms of u p, haryana,punjab & rajasthan for drawing more power & inconveniencing people 
question from performance of ipl teams so far: do teams with fewer stars empower players more? have less pressure? greater ownership?  we are seeing the first signs. but largely due to lack of options in sport.  on the contrary. that is only a method of representing results. not the tie-breaker as we know now 
big game for kkr today. auckland aces pretty good side. wonder how the track at capetown will be.  this without a cricket background is a bit overdone. played league cricket for 7 years in hyd, inc 3 in senior division.  as it now turns out he was wrong too! 
often the difference between winning and losing lies in the 1% things #thewinningway so what are the 1% things that work for you?  that is simplistic and emotional. neither much good in the face of an overwhelming reality.  no game difference wasn't equal for all 3. chinese taipei were better; japan/india were tied 
thanks abhishek. spread the word!  so deccan chargers reject the only bid they got. not surprising. hope not but fear long haul ahead on this one.  just to repeat,not about pts diff at all.if 3 teams tied,look at games won-lost.then head-head.pts diff only if game diff equal for all 3 
it's the attitude daraius...not just swinging wildly. you are not thinking of failure.....not trying to play safe....  but where does slpl come into this??? sri lanka are touring west indies!!  so the players didn't know, team management didn't know, media didn't know.....but as a result we got to see a really good performance. 
ref this old team photo  only one guy in glasses is me. sitting right extreme kiran reddy, next to him saad bin jung  suspect earlier tweet needs explanation! if sri lanka and the west indies are cash starved, they need more revenue generating cricket!  took a long phone call with to understand jwala & ashwini were out before match began. if no of games tied head-head,not pts 
prediction right! quote questionable!!  when you are finances are under strain, you put income first. can't play tests if they need revenues. sad but true  oops, wasn't aware that jwala and ashwini hadn't qualified. wonder if they were aware of the points rule. any clarity? 
yes, funny how many are asking which one i am..thought obvious! anyone else you recognise?  brilliant simon!  excellent discussion on cnn-ibn last night on indiscipline in the power sector. everyday we sink to new lows in public life. 
thanks to got to see this old photograph of our school cricket team.   knocking off of tests between sri lanka & west indies could well be another indicator that you can't buy cake if you can't afford bread  brilliant watching jwala gutta and ashwini ponnappa last night. with kashyap showing more signs that we are making headway in other sports 
it is the last day to vote for the books you like at the economist crossword popular books award  #thewinningway  knocking off of tests between sri lanka & west indies could well be another indicator that if you can't buy cake if you can't afford bread  will be brilliant if the story emerges in full so that we will be forced to look beyond this system to judge what does well! 
of course i do. ananta was a dear friend and a brilliant off spinner. hope he is well, would love to reconnect  very nice yesterday with the always insightful and credible imran khan.  hasn't done too well in domestic cricket 
how long will you be in capetown. get there tomorrow afternoon.  which then is not such a bad thing because it rewards superior ability. maybe pitches that favour better batsmen too?  not disturbing the winning XI is a very dangerous exercise if people within it are not delivering. 
some fast bowling talent emerging out of australia. cummins 19, hazlewood 20, starc 22, pattinson 21.  on the #reliancemobile, paid what they asked me to, now asking for more without activating the dongle. very very rude.  very interesting indeed. how credible is this site? 
thought the sydney sixers / csk match was much better. the sixers are the team to watch.  am i the only one at the receiving end of some extraordinarily rude customer service people at reliance mobile?  i personally believe rohit should be asked to do what vvs did when left out of the test team. he scored 12 hundreds to force his way back 
mumbai indians just didn't show enough fire. must concern them. will repeat. t20 is about fearless cricket.  rude today young man? often comprehension has to come before comment.  the team is backing rohit to do well and he might well come good because he has it in him but need to be careful about an unhappy bench. 
it is fairly to safe that we will see a lot more of quinton de kock. had heard lots of nice things about him, now i can state them.  thank you for your wishes. enjoyed today. see you on the 17th for the ind v pak warm up game from colombo. afternoon start.  gut feel is that team wants to play rohit but feels the need to play tiwary. his leg spin is very part-time though has been bowling a lot 
very clinical from the highveld lions today. neil mckenzie showed how to anchor a run chase.  mccullum seemed to enjoy the freedom of t20 after a trying time in the tests. it is clearly his best format and he's very good at it.  if you want to play tiwary as a batsman, no 7 is no place for him. and after irfan's fine effort he goes back to 8! 
very cloudy outside my window....hopefully will clear. two good games at champions league today. csk v sydney 6ers; mi vs highveld lions  no, i had asked him what he thought.  sri lanka should be happy with this ind team.back to 4 bowlers & part-timers.still maintain,in spite of his form,pathan is 1 of 5 not 1 of 4 
if you have the stamina, write the whole autobiography in tweet form....might become an interesting literary exercise!  yuvi will be work in progress for a while but just to see him back on a cricket ground is awesome. well done shabnam, you played a big part  so kashyap in the last 16. we are making progress. well done! 
lovely evening today in mandela square. really like the ambience there... nice place to catch up with a classmate after so many years!  wonderful to see yuvi back today. was at point early on which in itself was heartwarming. the cricket is there, needs a bit more energy.  another cricket match starts in an hour.good game, last one. who do you think will provide the quick start #MagnatecStart today? 
remember the titans won today without ab de villiers, faf du plessis and the morkel brothers. that is seriously good depth.  india left it till too late. 17 in 4 overs between 14 and 17 was the difference. think always better to be ahead of asking rate.  sequel to 3 idiots...2 velas? 
good pitches here producing good cricket at the champions league. the over from narine to pietersen was brilliant.  welcome to this fascinating world of twitter. looking forward to some straight talk!! trust all well  so you got both aalhad and ananya in it....... 
absolutely...a bit longer for me nagesh!!  i think you will find it on the net somewhere  doesn't matter which way or which angle or which perspective, if it reminds you of al pacino, i want nothing more!! 
bade bhai, hamaare shaher me aaye to aisich hota. aur bhi zabardast cheezan hai khane ku!  #thewinningway has been nominated for the crossword popular book award.can vote for it or for any book of your choice   leander / vishnu win too....nice way to end the day. sorry to flood timelines, but sport does that sometimes!!! 
bade bhai, hamaare shaher me aaye to aisich hota. aur bhi zabardast cheezan hai khane ku!  very dark in chennai .....and has just started pouring.....hopefully will stay away tomorrow  oh, leander-vishnu 5-2 in the decider now...will wait on. 
amazing atmosphere at the sandton sun. thousands of runs, hundreds of wickets passing by...all the teams here...it's all so "cricket"  er....no arif. was a bit late leaving the hotel and forgot to carry mine! borrowed another for the photograph!  on the net ian. at  follow links to countries and athletes playing today 
the usual in jo'burg. easy to get a new cellphone connection, pay a king's ransom to change money!  hadn't realised the one and only bishan bedi is on twitter welcome sir, look forward to some forthright comments  and on that note (easy for saina) time to call it a day even though leander-vishnu are 3-2 up in the decider with oppnents to serve 
fair call. saw the tweets. in my littler world have seen that happen too. interesting though...diff between "touched" and "fouled"  sometimes i'm told i'm pro-bcci, sometimes anti-bcci. never quite worked that out. all i know is that i am pro-cricket.  1 set all for leander and vishnuvardhan but saina running away with the first set here. 18-3 
don't flaunt it but follow it! but here's another observation. people responding to football tweets are ruder. any thoughts?  many!!  leander-vishnu break back. 4-4 in 2nd set now 
i think everyone admires man united but not everybody loves them  i have often wondered why indian cricket hasn't used a thinking man like more.   gagan narang talking warmly about rajyavardhan rathore on cnn-ibn.2 olympic medallists & a gold in between,bit of a tradition building up? 
it isn't. except that a goal is probably more critical than a wicket. but you must have heard me rant against fake appeals too!  like his subject we have come to expect much from   leander and vishnu vardhan now leading 7-6,1-0 
interesting how many people jumping to the defence of an english footballer here. message there!  didn't read the front page of the newspaper. so who let india down today?  following tennis scores here.  slow to upload though...or maybe just my net speed! 
so not dancing to korbo lorbo jeetbo in capetown? was hoping to say hello.  there is only 1 player that matters in women's tennis. serenal williams. if in form & in the mood she wins,only otherwise does someone else  meanwhile leander and vishnuvardhan 5-6 down but on serve in 1st set 
agree. eventually people must make use of science, technology and data and so they must be driven to do so.  ian chappell's piece confirms what i know about aussies.that beneath the swagger & machismo lie normal emotional people   remember india are trying to come back from nowhere. given that this was a spirited performance. 
on analytics and statistics and other interesting matters.   bit confused over the kp affair. were team-mates fuelling that twitter account? if so, shouldn't they be probed? what a mess!  whatever the result, india have looked fitter than before....and defending well too. nobbs effect? 
it is not mandatory is it, that everyone supports a club in the epl?  so pujara got congratulatory messages not just from dravid and vvs but also from ab de villiers. that is what i (cont)   so much action today with bhupathi and bopanna winning. remember olympics with no indian interest at all. we are getting somewhere 
strong believer in freedom of thought...welcome  oh dear, what terrible news to wake up to. dr #kurien, one of the greatest indians.....brought joy and good fortune to so many...  2-2 different indian team playing the second half!! 
ref this article on west indies winning t20  do you like wi cricket?if so why?fierce, independent thoughts welcome!  thanks for all the good wishes. means a lot. let's hope for good cricket in chennai.  india looking inadequate against the dutch. remember we are only late qualifiers.... 
anyway...at the champions league from sunday. chennai super kings vs sydney sixers & mumbai indians vs highveld lions  was looking forward to the game myself....see you in chennai. hopefully the weather along the east coast doesn't move there.  when was the last time you saw a sports minister watching a bout and acting on a result immediately. well done 
doesn't mean you ignore this vipul!  guess it wasn't meant to be. but top crowd at visakhapatnam. but the traffic getting out.......  why? what happened? 
excellent video from you may not agree with gary neville but that is what an "expert" is supposed to do.  just arrived in visakhapatnam and so looking forward to the game this evening.  in fact one of the english commentators called the sangwan verdict daylight robbery....just commentators vs judges i guess!! 
part of the reason lot of cheating allowed in sport is because people influencing opinion, and condoning it, have done it themselves.  the q&q with sourav ganguly yesterday at the dilip sardesai lecture.   don't understand how boxing is scored but the english commentators at sangwan's bout thought the judges were watching something else. 
don't agree with him but at least he plays expert on tv as an expert should be. don't get enough of that  ah, that's why you were trying to escape all the time!!  what an event this shooting is! one point less in qualification and gagan would have had no chance of a medal. 
you didn't do too badly yourself sneha! well done and look forward to more.  ah, that's why you were trying to escape all the time!!  apne gandipet ke paani me kuch hunga. pehle saina ab gagan! 
latest article on the west indies win and why we are all happy   in england you mean!  he kept his cool. very very happy for #gagannarang. most deserving. a great journey and he can be so proud of himself 
michael owen admits he used to dive. so cheat when you are young, admit when older? is there an honest footballer? or cyclist?  pity the correspondent didn't notice who put the questions. without a pass there is no goal!  met gagan narang a few times at olympic gold quest events. seemed fiercely ambitious. can he stay calm? what a day if he can get gold. 
true.realised when i saw hyderabad blues & recognised my classroom!he joined year i passed out so missed each other  not just cricketers anand, cricketlovers too!  final shooting score here. was following on the net  final live on espn hd and espn at 1645 
that's what a lot of people do in oz with that is the real joy and challenge of the radio broadcaster.  yohan,rajiv & greg have done the indian version of "i've been everywhere".  suggest hear the johnny cash version first  bad luck abhinav, but you will remain one of india's greatest ever. now, go gagan! 
interesting actor-singer combos what's your choice?   wonderful crowd at the bombay gymkhana. full of cricket lovers. could do with more such warm crickety evenings.  looks like the cut is at 596. bindra shot 594. waiting for confirmation 
"good head" that's a new one. i was always told i had a great face for radio!  enjoyed the chat with ganguly at the sardesai lecture. live tv instincts handy!  looks like abhinav has finished 16th and gagan narang 3rd in qualifying. 
hi haven't worked with bbc tms for a while now but abc granstand as good as any possible.loved tim lane too.tim&jim nice ring!  fair call. didn't realise there were six plus franklin and williamson  can't see on tv here. trying to follow on the net. but can't figure out scoring pattern. 
ran into fredun recently. the smile is intact  guptill, mccullum, williamson, taylor, franklin, oram, vettori, mccullum, mills, southee, bracewell. looks a very decent side.  it is not just a man's skill that makes a difference. sometimes mere presence, as with can lift team spirit 
saw her at the airport last year. found myself rehearsing lines to walk across and say hello!  and i hope you can play it, even if late  caught last 15 minutes brazil vs belarus. and the first time i saw neymar. sensational. how do we see more of him? 
flood of responses to commentators tweet.pity we don't have quality radio commentary in india: it is the most beautiful medium for cricket.  looking forward to hosting the dilip sardesai lecture this evening. sourav ganguly speaks. should be fun  now that is how you start if you want to be seen as a serious contender. saina wins 21-9 21-4 
so who were your favourite commentators from the past? mine were anant setalvad and dicky rutnagar. measured and dignified.  sometimes i fear we are too obsessed with numbers and controversy when the real reason we fell in love with this (cont)   was away at lunch and missed the 1330 action. looks like i only missed the bad news in archery and shooting. go sarwan singh in rowing!! 
i genuinely like it nimesh. yes you can have differences over which teams should play but inherently it is a good tournament.  i know i took a dig at the aussies with the t20 rankings tweet but remember those rankings don't mean much with such few games played!!  word spreads i can see! just thought it was a fresh, practical perspective. cheers. 
true. but do like the idea of club teams playing each other. for someone who can't play int ckt it's a great moment in the sun  so australia playing the t20 tonight to stay above ireland in the rankings!!!!  to follow india at the olympics (and by extension any country you want to!)  
early radio days, the team from chepauk was balu alaganan, rt parthasarathy and anand rao  heisenberg,debroglie,planck,curie,einstein,bohr in 1 photograph.wow!.same solvay whose "process" we studied in such detail?  as i understand the draw, if india do beat denmark at women's archery they play korea in the quarter-final. tough? any experts there? 
uplifting as sport is some of us get limited by it. feel that acutely.  ahem!!  will mail them rightaway. thanks for telling me. assuming you won!! 
and a 100 dollars everytime a player says it....always wondered.....don't they play for pride otherwise? see you soon.  weekly article on yuvraj's comeback. what do you think?   correction: the suggestion came from think i might have missed an 'i' 
tell you, eventually the mob gets to you shri wilkinson!  for all you guys asking for ojha, ishant, yadav etc, need to look at squad picked!  it has been suggested by that if i am promoting hash tags i must state association. good thought. will do. 
interesting thought. not just kp was owais shah a better bet at no5 for england?   other possibility is that rohit plays for bhajji and dhoni backs yuvraj to bowl 4 overs with raina & rohit as reserve  ok thought some knew. have done a lot of work with castrol over the last 14 years. thought #MagnatecStart would be interesting 
and what would he do to check if you had one.....see you on the morning run maybe!  how's this for the t20 team? sehwag, gambhir, kohli, yuvraj, dhoni, raina, pathan, ashwin, harbhajan, zaheer, balaji? ?  was an article that got forwarded and thought it was sensible rather than the normal thoughtless ranting...... 
yes, finance prof and one of my father's favourite students.  meanwhile a solid hardworking cricketer makes a comeback to the indian team   no firdose moonda who is covering the series apparently said that neither amla nor tahir are fasting on match days 
great line "Younger than I feel like; older than I want to be."  newspapers need to stand for dignity. people believe you and so there is a responsibility that you carry.  a very interesting woman's perspective on clothes women wear from seema goswami  
ah, that's what aggan means...never quite figured out! and don't think i missed much!  aha! does your gut have an independent voice?? see you tomorrow.  vijender's win too late to watch but felt for young thapa. only 18 he will emerge stronger and hopefully will get the encouragement 
ah, at last we agree!  respect martin crowe's cricketing judgement  another gambhir innings, #MagnatecStart, that resulted in a win. on the sub-continent he is a serious match winner...now to do it away. 
ummm, do i see the inspiration for a contemporary feature film here......."prem ki aag"  think it is called   irfan pathan showed yesterday the great merit of playing a balanced side. look upon him as the 5th bowler and you will see his value 
an absolutely astonishing blog from even if i say so myself.  from pure maths to d/l to rajesh khanna......  did you spot that somewhere in my message? 
in 3 days ravi rampaul & samuel badree went from helping west indies to the t20 world title to failing to qualify for the champions league  no doubt ajmal is a great spinner. and no doubt the pitches there are very good for him. 
briefly caught yorkshire's celebration at making main draw before going to bed. that is why i like champions league. great stage for some  dear if your top5 popular people list begins with poonam pandey i don't want to be on it!! 
i'd be careful was only pretending to be at the worldt20.actually was practising his golf!  i think you should aim higher! 
he was in the 83 world cup team that had india 17-5. was also a tennis player by the same name around that time.  by the sound of it yes....excellent chemistry teacher. 
thanks puru. tell me what you think after finishing it. cheers. #thewinningway  if you have tough, committed, respected selectors you tend not to have debates....because you accept their judgement! 
nice coffee and your usual good cheer should do it tom!  one of the reasons everyone is having a debate on the tendulkar issue is that the selectors aren't. maybe the new lot will! 
hoping to see some really good cricket in south africa. comms:gavaskar,shastri, bhogle,moody,mbangwa,ackerman,doull, raja,ganga,wilkins  my friends sam & jarrod and their production : death of a gentleman (on test cricket)  needs funding. can people help? 
champions league qualifiers begin today. some excellent matches at this stage last year esp from t&t and kkr.  shhhh! sanjay aikel! 
oops correction: 4 out of 5 in a decent west zone line up!!  that article i just tweeted about  came courtesy of 
one bit of good news from indian cricket. ishant sharma seems to be bowling well again. 4 of the top 5 in a decent rest of india line-up  interesting...on what some consultants have to do...  
a leader takes his/her team to places they have never been to before #thewinningway  no i don't think that will be necessary. objective is to solve not to sensationalise. i still love my school dearly. 
they cannot do stings. have very few powers. cannot prosecute for eg. so must do as much education/prevention as they can  in touch with him?...would be overjoyed to resume contact with him...top man 
what i said in my next tweet. important but people need to watch too. but wasn't the title misleading?  but jonathan, that's what i thought you waited the whole year for! there is no greater city than london in summer! 
i think it is important to expose bad eggs, and it seems there are many, but this was so difficult to watch...  if any of you are students of hps-b, do pass this sad reality onto the principal....have no contacts there anymore but very fond memories 
i got the feeling that the "sting" was a reality show not an expose. maybe will search for a "summary"!!  made a donation to my school (hps begumpet) some years ago to institute awards in teachers' names. sadly they took the money & did nothing. 
i really tried watching the "sting" on india tv last night. but the voice-over made me cringe and switch off.  and while on teachers nsj devadattam who was in charge of our cricket looked so stern from the outside and meant so well. 
ah tom, sadly mr ackerman is in our group it seems. and mr doull is in top form i gather!  just thinking of my teachers and what an impact they had. john mathai helped me love chemistry and sw chandrashekhar was just a star. 
conversation with on west indies cricket.   of course there was but as i understand in bradman's time ball had to pitch in line and hit in line. 
brilliant. wish you all the best.hopefully will run into you guys somewhere. am doing the games there on the 20th  aah, pride in the roots then! 
yes one of the world's great sports loving countries. looking forward to being there again  looking forward to describing you play in vizag! 
thanks guys  pietersen. ab de villiers. wouldn't discount mike hussey and jayawardene 
cricket never stops does it....my next stop champions league. a tournament i like. great stage for club players too. am on air from the 14th  hope the people applying meet the standards you set. great cover story on ex-militants in kashmir. 
you're lucky you haven't met ian chappell.....is very particular about the 'l' in "'straya"!!  once did commentary on odi games starting at 1700 hrs. this in dubai is even later. is it good for the game? 
gomes was one of the unheralded stars of that west indies team. but possible....remember gayle was a middle order player too  guess afridi is a legend in pakistan....but at the moment is hafeez a more valuable player? 
don't worry. thanks for asking but love this game too much. just stating a point of view!!  thanks really enjoyed being with the students of the aditya birla world academy. 
absolutely. that was a thought for cricket lovers!  sometimes we imagine things where they don't exist. relax! 
yes i really do hope so because as you can see, the world loves, and needs, a strong west indies  and so, therefore, it cannot correct a wrong now? 
disagree completely. different skills. don't benchmark against test cricket skills.  no don't try to read between the lines. 
in what way?  pujara and kohli showing that however sentimental we might be the next kid always comes along. it is the way of the world. 
if you look at the great west indies sides maybe gayle would have got in (but remember greenidge/haynes!) & in later years maybe samuels  ah between iphone5 & #fireinbabylon i would be far more interested in the latter!! 
let us not expect a major revival in the west indies. i think t20 will become very popular and those kind of cricketers will emerge  oops #fireinbabylon releases sep 21 not 12 as i mentioned. 
any friends in the islands of the caribbean here? do tell us of the excitement there. will this help revive cricket or only, as i fear, t20?  for all lovers of "that" great west indies era #fireinbabylon releases on sep 12. have seen it and you must too 
i endorse his views and i really like clt20  on a surface like this a more experienced side would have troubled india more. new zealand will be disappointed they didn't set india 300 
on at 1930 (and again at 2100) on cnn-ibn about west indies cricket.  the advantage of playing in home conditions; the target never looks out of sight. but well played kohli and dhoni 
brought back many memories of the great rediff on the net.....the best editorial product on the net.  oh dear, looking for mid-wicket again. less than half the bat offered...... 
and memories of an extraordinary, outstanding editorial product.  then life is very different! 
how many of us really understand depression?  tendulkar through the off side is a treat to watch, get worried when he seeks to play through mid-wicket. those 2 boundaries were sumptuous. 
that sounds like many other things !!!  pujara looking very stylish but clearly the bowlers think he doesn't like the short ball. 
it must be hard, you must have known her well  if you want to win a test match this is how you bat. positive strokeplay. pitch helping too. glorious test cricket 
you know you are in a losing team when getting credit becomes more important than getting the job done #thewinningway  no digvijay, nothing to do with the result 
as my friend said both teams seemed to play the occasion rather than the opponent.  if it ever needed proving this test match does again. good wickets produce good cricket. well done ksca. 
once the dust settles we will realise that in spite of the samuels innings and the mendis spell this wasn't the greatest cricket match.  yes but to some extent that depends on the target. the 207-3 could have been stretched to 300 
love your cricket. looking forward to one of those from you!  taylor keeps going back to that heave..brings him runs but too dangerous. thought nz, with a bit more patience,could have been better placed 
hope you have an excellent season....and tell us more about indian cricket.  india should back themselves to win from here.still good surface to bat on.new zealand have to strike with the new ball to have a chance 
is there any team other than the west indies that spreads joy across continents when it wins? brazil maybe? anyone else?  yes introspection is fine and often needed even for the best. my concern is the quality of language 
"if jesus christ could no wrong and still get crucified who is darren sammy?"  hi paddy. good to read that post. trust you are well. do give my regards to garry as well on the great win. harsha 
sometimes, only sometimes, a hunch comes good. this was the article:   can't imagine kind of language used about sachin. just to show up these fair weather followers want him to play a cracker in the 2nd innings 
cricinfo: sep 14 : "To me, this World Twenty20 will be a search for the joy in West Indies cricket. Anyone can (cont)   he might need to be fit first 
had marlon samuels as one of my players to watch out for in 2001. for a long time thought it was talent wasted. not any more!  sarcastic? no just simple english. 
i was in sri lanka for a major part of the tournament and i can tell you it was wonderfully organised. well done sri lanka. good hosts.  i believe that in future ashwin could allow india to play five bowlers regularly. looked as much a batsman as anyone in this game. 
thought post match interviews excellent. samuels & sammy particularly. sri lankans will be disappointed but this is a good day for cricket  philander, and now southee, showing that if you can swing the ball, batsmen will always be vulnerable. 
sri lanka will rue missed opportunities. of all their finals this was their best chance. it was theirs to lose.  one day trent boult will bowl far worse than this and pick up many more wickets. potential to become key bowler 
was watching the most extraordinary victory celebration i have ever seen. so spontaneous and so full of good cheer. they are something else!  hugely impressed with ravichandran ashwin.batting one number below where he can, certainly in home conditions. 
for all you guys looking for conclusions,only tweeting as i see it...not supporting a side!!  very well done. was good to see you smiling a couple of days ago....looking forward to more.... 
no not at all. just a cricket lover telling it as he sees it.  thought i might have a decent persepctive after doing it all these years!! 
he's not always delivered on the big day  no radio commentary far easier. no comparison at all. pity world class radio commentary not available to india. 
106 in the last 10, 90 in the last 8. suggests it cannot be a bad pitch.  better now? 
west indies something to play with but sri lanka still favourites. jayawardene, sangakkara strong characters,won't allow top order collapse  field restrictions on, 10 wickets available, overall asking rate less than opposition? proves d/l no good over 20 ov 
malinga still a top bowler but the pace has deserted him. has to be crafty. batsman alive to the fact that he now takes the pace off  in the slpl final uva next needed 137 from 15 9.1. after 5.1 d/l target 44 how can that be right? 
herath bowling now? quality left armer on a helpful pitch against a succession of right handers? still think he should have been in  it's not just the hairstyle that's made tendulkar look different this session 
i agree it will be great for world cricket if the west indies win. but try telling that to a sri lanka looking for pride post the war!!  test cricket requires you to watch intently to derive maximum joy...a quick check of the scores doesn't tell you much. 
will repeat. sri lanka are the better side. and they must believe so. must ride the pressure. they are playing west indies not gayle  this has been as compelling test cricket as any you will see. southee and boult showing up india's batting a bit here!! 
sometimes too much dependance on one player can be dangerous for a team. for west indies to win, they cannot rely only on gayle  my thoughts on south africa's ascent to no 1.  
but dananjaya over herath also an example of how sri lankans back raw talent and throw them in. must be a great feeling for an 18 year old  with senior management of stanchart today for #thewinningway. reassuring to see such acceptance of our programme. 
bit baffled by dananjaya over herath. picking a team for gayle? must back others to get him out...herath very good bowler against all others  but mark, how is it gentlemanly for a batsman to run a yard less to complete a run, even after he has been warned? 
like many aren't as good commentators as they are cricketers!! was done in 2008  if a batsman out of his crease before a bowler has entered his delivery stride don't see why he needs a warning.in karthik case,was warned 
thank you pooja...you must be a cricket lover then....  law 42.15 (fair and unfair play) The bowler is permitted, before entering his delivery stride, to attempt to run out the non-striker. 
kya karen...cricket lover jo ban baithe hum!  to be honest, the warning is optional too, not mandatory. exuberant young men get out slogging too. 
on a big day maybe. also 40 overs will have been bowled on it in the women's final. you well? baby good?  without a shadow of doubt. the rules are the same, the batsman is being lax, especially if he has been warned 
just finished reading this search for messi from   the spirit of the game should also include preventing a batsman from seeking an unfair advantage by backing up too far. 
wasn't the same pitch....completely different!  have never figured out the fuss over a batsman backing up too far being run out. the batsman is taking advantage, he deserves to be out. 
sri lanka have better balance, and superior bowling in these condtions. west indies the more explosive side in good batting conditions.  since some were asking here is the link to the kindle version of #thewinningway  
if dry, crumbly pitch today, fear a no-contest. if pitch like the one for wi-oz, should be good contest.  didn't know.only reach 16th morning
