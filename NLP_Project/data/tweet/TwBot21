Two people are connected at heart, it doesn't matter what you do, there are no boundaries or barriers if they are destined to be together. 
There comes a point when you just love someone, not because they're good, bad, or anything really. You just love them the way they are.. 
You love someone. It doesn't mean you'll be together forever. It doesn't mean you won't hurt each other. It just mean you love them. 
Your smile is contagious, no matter how angry or sad I am, all I need is to take one look at your smile and everything seem a little better. 
A relationship with no trust is like a car with no gas. You can stay in it, but it won't go anywhere. 
As long as we can see the same sky, breathe the same air, step on the same planet, then you and I are not impossible. 
Anniversary weekend ❤  
Fall in love with someone that deserves your heart, not someone who plays with it. 
Everytime I think of you, I get the biggest smile on my face and you still don't understand how much you mean to me. 
How can you not notice me when my heart is so obviously screaming your name?

The best relationships usually begin unexpectedly. 
When two people are meant for each other, nothing can keep them apart. 
A woman's heart is not a toy. Anyone who treats it as such is not a man, but a boy.

So many tears wasted on you.

When I say I love you, please believe its true. When I say forever, you know I'll never leave you. 
To love someone is to understand each other, to laugh together, to smile with your heart, and to trust one another. 
One important thing in love someone is to let each other go if you can't do this anymore. 
One half of your life is what you do with it, the other half is who you're with while you're doing it. 
Don't rush into anything, the right person will wait on you as long as it takes. 
If you care too much; you'll get hurt, if you care too little; you'll lose them. It's your choice! 
No relationship is a waste of time. The wrong ones teach you the lessons that prepare you for the right ones.

Sometimes you miss the memories, not the person. 
Loving him was hard to forget, losing him was hard to accept, but with all the hurt I've felt, letting go is the most painful yet. 
People ask why I read love stories so much, maybe it's because I know I'll never get one of my own. 
Because of you, I laugh a little louder, cry a lot less, and smile a lot more. 
Many people know innocent love, complicated love, and disappointed love, but those lucky few know un-conditional love. 
I'm just sick of putting on a fake smile and acting like everything is ok. I'm hurting but I refuse to ever let you realize that. 
When someone rejects you, it's ok, because now they can keep their bag of rocks, while someone else has a beautiful diamond.

A broken heart can heal, but that doesn't mean there's no scars. 
I miss you, I adore you, but of all... I love you more than anything. 
I've always wondered what hurts more, the pain of wondering or the pain of knowing the truth. 
The happiest people with the biggest smiles are sometimes the best actors. 
Time for me to open my eyes and accept the reality and see... it's not that bad. 
Thank you for coming into my world, I hope someday it could be our world. 
Before I go to sleep, I think of YOU, when I fall asleep, I dream about YOU. I wake up the next day and it starts all over again. 
Watching you walk away from my life does not make me bitter or cynical about love... 
But rather makes me realize that if I wanted so much to be with the wrong person, how beautiful it will be when the right one comes along. 
You can't judge my choices without knowing my reasons. 
Why don't I ever run into anything cool like this sp?  
Every moment we spend together is a little more than amazing. 
There is never a time or place for true love. It happens accidentally, in a heartbeat, in a single flashing, or throbbing moment. 
With all the smiles you brought me, I never thought that you could cause me so many tears. 
If you're not making an effort in our relationship, why should I? 
I would give up everything for one moment with you, for one moment is better than a lifetime of not knowing you. 
Don't ever say you're not good enough because if he can't see how amazing you really are then he's the one who's not good enough. 
I'm single, sexy, free to flirt, wanna be in love, but don't wanna get hurt.

Never lie to the person you love, because it's not worth it and they don't deserve it. 
Perfect guy is not the one who has more money or the most handsome one you'll met. Its the one who knows how to makes you smile everyday. 
Never cry for someone who hurts you, just smile and say "thanks for giving me a chance to find someone better than you."

You can be a sweet dream or a beautful nightmare, either way... I don't wanna wake up from you. 
God made you, then He made me, and then He whispered... "Meant to be". 
Safety first! Part of love is sex, and part of sex is being smart. Read this on birth control, like, now sp >>  
Someday, you'll wake up and realize that you just let the best thing to ever happen to you slip through your fingers. 
Never be so dependent on one person, that you think you cannot live without them. 
I remember when we used to talk everyday. I really miss that moment. 
If you're mine, you're only mine. I don't like sharing. 
Sometimes, the girl that's been there for everyone else needs someone to be there for her. 
Nothing hurts more than waiting since I don’t even know what I’m waiting for anymore.

Those nights when you can't sleep is perhaps you just might be in someone elses dreams. 
First dates are awkward, first kisses are heavenly, first loves are irreplaceable, and first heartbreaks are unforgettable. 
I don't care how many fish there are in the sea. I don't want a fish, I want you! 
Is it me or do we all want this to be our next new car?  #sp 
Sometimes, we just have to let go of someone who matters to us not because we have to, but because it's the right thing to do. 
Sometimes, we just have to let go of someone who matters to us not because we have to, but because it's the right thing to do. 
Let us remember that we can't force anyone to love us. 
We can't beg someone to stay when she/he wants to leave and be with someone else. This is what love is all about. 
The end of love is not the end of life. It should be the beginning of understanding that leaves for a reason, but leaves with a lesson. 
All I want is for a guy to say "I'll protect you", even though he's knows I can do it perfectly well on my own. 
When you finally realize how special she really is, she'll be with the guy who already knew. 
A part of me says I want you, a part of me says I'm better off without you. 
When you want love, don't run after it or you might get tired of it, just walk until it gets tired, gives up, and sincerely takes you. 
Sometimes, you wait so long for something that when it finally arrives... you are no longer need it. 
Your smile says you've got it together, but your eyes are telling me it's not true. 
Sometimes, your heart can't afford to be "Just friends". 
Never change who you are just because you're afraid of losing them. If they really love you, your imperfections won't matter. 
Sometimes, all you can do is laugh to keep yourself from crying. 
You can walk away and say that we don't need this, but something in your eyes says we can beat this. 
These are the best songs to, um... "get it on" to  #sp ;) you're welcome! 
Talk about a cool job... YOU can work here...  #sp :) 
It hurts when you have someone in your heart but you can't have them in your arms. 
I miss having someone that cares about what I did yesterday, what I'm doing right now, and what I'm going to do tomorrow. 
No one realized just how much I loved you until you left me and they saw the silent tears coming from my heart. 
The worst part about falling in love with a friend is knowing that it's all you'll ever be to them. 
Sometimes, I just want to run to see if you'll want me back. 
If you ever begin to miss me, just look at the spaces in between your fingers and know that mine should be there. 
I'm not mad you found someone else. I'm mad you put on a show for me. 
#DontTextMeSaying you miss me. I don't you to say that, I want you to PROVE that. 
Love is the MOST powerful of ANY emotion and the only one of which you have absolutely NO control. 
You don't choose love, it chooses you and when it has it's grip on you, there's no escaping its clutches, it takes over your every thought. 
I'm not afraid of telling you my feeling, but what I fear is what you will say back. 
If you love someone, you better prove it because if you don’t... they might not believe it. 
Love is not a noun to be defined, but a verb to be acted upon. 
Studies show that 40% of women have thrown this at a man before! >>  #sp
