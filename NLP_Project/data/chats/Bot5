shit man..i am not well verse with een one language :(
bt still..
dude..cmon..we both know that u know much more in C than i do..
i learn't it in 1st sem here..
exp also..and confidence level also..
n comfort level also..
yea
hmm
i dunno if its like using jsp over servlets..
bith have diff purposes
*bot
*both
servlets are for getting your input n all..
all the logic n all
and jsp is jus for view purpose
though u can do sometimes all that in a jsp also..but mostly we write servlets only..
you can write the login code in servlet..and once done..u can redirect to the jsp page..
wer it will just display the user details
basically..after u login..get the data from DB using select..and then print the data using jsp..
yes
what u can do is once logged in..redirect to jsp file..udhar hi write the query for selecting user details and then print it..
bcoz creating a servlet for profile page is of no use
nope..
u can pass the user id from servlet..
so that u know on runtime which user's details to display..
yes
no probs dude..even i didn't know all this..learn't it from purvesh..
i don't like web development..
i suck at it..
not when u have deadlin in 10 days :P
else its fun to explore..when u don't have any restrictions
these girls have divided the work..
nice na..not much stress only then..
yeah
done with negotiations with amazon?
kya bole?

E-R continued
and then started with relational algebra..
are dude..aap toh gayab hi ho gaye
are online disat nai..

i went..came back in 5 mins :P
kahi nai..time pass..
HSC?
asach?
are chapin mein se le
oh
u go ahead dude..
i said na..i went but came back in 5 mins..these girls wer doing it..
y u din go?
oh..hows it going?
hmm
hw much is left?
ohh :(
hehe..ya..the subject is kool..
hehe
dude..aditya is saying HSC is closed..
for today
it closes at 7
on sat
nope..
nai..if u include the name "ID" in table of Transcript..then its a foreign key
StudID is Transcript's own field..
Now here its a bit ambigous
because we don't have a ER diagram..or a relation schema..
normally, transcript should be a weak entity to student
so the ID field of Student will automatically become a key in Transcript
hmm..yeah..but i wasn't sure about it
cool :D
hehe
goggled :P
but when we say Foreign Key StudID references Student..won't it search for StudID field in Student rather than searching for ID?
i mean is there any way of renaming the foreign key?
oh..my bad..syntax error i made..
yeah..u right..
mostly not..i am in CA till 6..
oh really?..faltugiri..
sagylana reject aala
yeah..
