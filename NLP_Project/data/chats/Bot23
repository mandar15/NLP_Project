In this..for 1 stop..flight won't change

but why didn't you book return tickets?
are as it is you won't get a direct flight to Cali or anywhere..
it will stop somewhere
so what you could have done is kept the stuff in NY to anyone's place..and while returning, just take it back :)

are tell the answer of 2nd question you asked yest..
even odd numbers in array
even in even locations..odd in odd locations..
do you have a solution in O(n) ??
okk
yes
then?
yes
I was thinking on same lines..but couldn't find a solution..
anyways..ya then..
hmm..I don't think the answer will come with this approach..
try with this example..
the order gets screwed up with that pointer approach..
if we try to do in linear time..
ya ya..no hurries..
kuch nai..reading paper..
have to write critique for 2 papers :P
are shot laglay
paper vaachayla
ya..1 paper is of 12 pages..
and in 1 sitting its difficult to understand properly..
so 2-3 padhna padta hai..
2 paper every lecture..
anyways..tuzha kay challay?
hehe..ok..
NLP toh I have everything left..
oh i see
hehe
kutle question vichar
careercup che
okk
O(n) se bhi kam?
when only 1 number..we can use binary search right..
lol..is it right?
we need to check both halves but..
not just one..
2 * log(n)
ya..
hmm okk
okk
for previous question..if we have to find all the numbers in correct place..then we can't do better than O(n) right?
only if we have to find 1 number..then its less than O(n)??
oh..so even you know only O(n) solution?
okk
okies..
gn sd tc
yes
cool
are I will email him later..
