coz i applied for credit card very late
its 750 credit limit
yes the banks come oncampus
u could open an acoutn with them that time
upto u
thats what i dont remember
but i remember giving my pay stub for makign the credit card
y do u need credit card now
u can get a debit card
and then later apply fr credit card
once u come here u can speak with the bank
debit card comes when u open an account
they post the debit card n it comes to ur address
cool
arre
pay stub is like
when u get paid for an oncampus job na
the stmt of how much u got
thats called the pay stub
thats one of the doc they ask making a credit card
yes
TFCU is a bank
Teachers federal credit union
u can
i hav both boa n tfcu
boa comes on campus
what limit
there are 2 cards....debit card and credit card
hope u know that
debit card - u use the money in ur account
credit card - u use the money first and pay later
credit limit is 750
thats credit card limit is 750
no no
boa has lot of restrictions for credit card
u need to have credit history

yaa
aug 5
yaa
no
search for classes
which one r u registering for
i'l tell u the class number
Algo is 548
i think
see the one for Bender
lect are also shown as TUT
see to it that they r 3 credits each
ya u can
did u read the graduate booklet
u can take Independent study
under any prof
but independent study u can find after coming here
just register for courses
u can drop later
usualy erez zadok is the best for OS
but hes not taking it this fall
hes on sabatical
donald potter is taking it
hes also good i hav heard
he taught adv OS this sem
sekar is taking it rt?
wats the prof name on solar
hes god
but very hectic... screws ppl
indian profs not prefered here
specialy AI...dont even think about it
u can register for it n keep
security
after u come here
for a week u can audit classes
after 10days of sem start, is the deadline to drop
thats a lot of days
jennifer wong
jie gao
radu grosu
no idea
even i hav registered for it
just for radu
ya mayb
i took
algo under bender
sys sec under rob johnson
os under erez zadok
IS under jie gao
no independednt study
dont take subjects under iv ramakrishnan
basically avoid indian profs
they r bad at giving grades
yes
he was lucky that the prof allowed him to do thesis in a yr
usualy u opt for thesis in 2 sem
2nd*
u can try
depends on ur interest
every prof has diff area of interest
yes
so see which matches ur interest
u can approach him/her then
dont know yet
am considering him too
yup
thats y i told u to do it
bound to happen
waitlist is closed too rt
i doubt they'l increase capacity this time coz another prof himanshu is taking it
am sure his classs willl hav seats
u can try in spring sem to take algos
ya u can
audit the classes
see if u like him
ok
no prob
cya
all d best
when u coming here
booked ticket
?
ohk
ok nice
cya
u apply for courses thru solar
the fees wil show in ur solar
u pay it before the deadline
i had bought a chk here n paid
u can also transfer directly
so in short u can apply before paying
n better apply soon
bender is good for algos
jie gao, wong and grosu are light subjects
light profs
OS is good subj
n potter is a good prof
comparatively light
ya coparatively
12 credits
4 courses
u hav to take
31 credits
12-12-9
done in 1.5 years
ya u can
but that wil bcome hectic
12 credits only is hectic
u'l kno when u come here
ok
cya
byee
no temme
not really
but i remmebr i had got it well in advance .. no last minute worries
but some had got it very late
u can do that
ya
some of us had done that
but am not sure how it works
as far as i rember i had got mine via DHL
n i dint pay any
during our time ther was some misunderstanding
but i dont think u need to
they will send it
Lourdes who was incharge of all this had gone on leave
yes
Hi
wassup
housing deposit
Graduate / Family Apt. Deposit
i think
dont remember properly
chk it
does it allow u to
it asks for preferences n all
ok
u've finalised on stony?
very weird
wat u saying
coz for ur grades u shud hav got ufl
u dint get CE
they giv for CE
n waiver
comp engg
ppl who apply for cs there, get admit saying if u take CE, they'l giv a waiver as well
couple of my frnds got it that way
in the admit only they mention
they apply for CS only
wat does ur reply say?
is it clearly written rejet?
oh
thats sad
ok
now once u hav made ur decision
keep an eye for course openings too
u have to takae courses for fall
can u see Student Records & Registration
on solar
ya
yes
ya
but mostly they are not considered
so dont keep hopes
trust ur luck
u can change later once u come here
see the sunysb website
2bhk has 4 ppl
3bhk has 6
ya
if there are vacant houses
worse come worse, u can change in spring
after end of sem 1
i pay 440
2bhk
it will b around that much
yes
remmebr to pay the deposit soon
later ppl get housing in schomberg n west apts
n monthly there is 600+
almost till 900
so dont lose out on the room selection
n all graduates stay here in chapin
u'l hav lots of indians n chinese
good
u shud
luck matters tho
fil the preference form n all
finish all those formalities
first round starts around dec
for full time actually
but internships also u get
next round is in march- theres a job fair
n u obviously apply online directly too
so it all goes well
dont worry
i got internship in dec
summer internship
Morgan Stanley

Stop
Ohk
Which r ur priorties
In terms of accepting
Univ
Ya
N if u get admits from all .. then?

Hmm
If u get a waiver, consider ufl
That's if u can't take the weather here
Financial firms r lot in ny
So there's confusion for sure
Ufl if u get waiver shud b d same as stony
But u can't do oncampus if u get a waiver
Yes
Yes
